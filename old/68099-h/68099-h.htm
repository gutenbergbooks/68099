  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Of the three English writers whose work has
become a portion of all Political Economy, Malthus
is the second in time and in honour. His services
to general theory are at least equal to Ricardo’s; and
his full illustration of one particular detail will rank
with the best work of Adam Smith.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the following pages the detail will be the
main subject, and general theory the episode. The
<cite>Political Economy</cite> and minor writings of Malthus
(which are not few) will be noticed only in relation
to the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly, the First of these Five Books will deal
with the genesis, history, and contents of the Essay,
plunging the reader <em>in medias res</em> and keeping him
there, till the facts force him, in the Second Book,
to recur with the author to Economical theory. The
Third will show the mind of Malthus more clearly
by adding to his economics his Ethics and Political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Philosophy; and the Fourth, with the case now fully
stated, will criticize the Critics of the Essay, and try
to determine how much of its doctrine remains still
valuable. The Fifth Book, with its Biography, may
help the reader to associate the living personality of
the man with his writings.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>BOOK I. THE ESSAY.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c014'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='large'>FIRST THOUGHTS, 1798.</span></h3>
<p class='c015'>The Common Caricature—The Essay an Inquiry into the Poverty of
Nations—Godwin’s <cite>Political Justice</cite> and <cite>Enquirer</cite>—The Two Postulates
and Conclusions from them—Condorcet’s <cite>Sketch of the
Progress of the Human Mind</cite>—Organic Perfectibility of Man and its
Obstacles—Historical Context of the Essay—<cite>The Crisis</cite>—Pitt’s Poor
Bill—Malthus and his Teachers—Success explained—Theology
and Metaphysics—Faults of the Essay—Immediate aim secured.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was the “best-abused man of the age.” Bonaparte
himself was not a greater enemy of his species. Here
was a man who defended small-pox, slavery, and
child-murder; who denounced soup-kitchens, early
marriage, and parish allowances; who “had the
impudence to marry after preaching against the evils
of a family;” who thought the world so badly
governed that the best actions do the most harm;
who, in short, took all romance out of life and
preached a dull sermon on the threadbare text—“Vanity
of vanities, all is vanity.” Such was the
character of Malthus as described by his opponents.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>If an angry man is probably in the wrong, an
abusive man is certainly so; and, when not one or
two, but one or two thousand are engaged in the
abuse, the certainty amounts to a demonstration.
We may measure the soundness of the victim’s logic
by the violence of the personal attacks made upon
him. For most worldly purposes, to be ignored and
to be refuted are the same thing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus from the first was not ignored. For thirty
years it rained refutations. The question, as he
stated it, was thoroughly threshed out. The <cite>Essay
on Population</cite> passed in the author’s lifetime through
six editions (1798, 1803, 1806, 1807, 1817, and
1826); even between the first edition, in 1798, and
the second, in 1803, there were more than a score
of ‘Replies’; and the discussion was carried on in
private correspondence, as well as in public journals
and parliamentary speeches. The case was fully
argued; and no one who fairly considers the extent
of the discussion, and the ability of the disputants,
can fail to believe that we have, in the records of this
controversy, ample materials for forming our own
judgment on the whole question in dispute.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a privilege is seldom used. The world
has no time to consult authorities, though it likes
them to be within reach of consultation. When an
author becomes an authority, he too often ceases
to be read, and his doctrines, like current coin,
are worn by use till they lose the clear image
and superscription of the issuer. In this way an
author’s name may come to suggest, not his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>book, but the current version of his doctrines.
Malthus becomes Malthusianism,—Darwin, Darwinism;
and if Adam Smith’s name were more
flexible he too would become an epithet.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> As it is,
Adam Smith has left a book which “every one
praises and nobody reads,” Malthus a book which
no one reads and all abuse. The abuse is, fortunately,
not quite unanimous; but it is certain that
Malthus for a long time had an experience worse
than Cassandra’s, for his warnings were disbelieved
without being heard or understood. Miss Martineau,
in her girlhood, heard him denounced “very
eloquently and forcibly by persons who never saw
so much as the outside”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of his book. This was in
1816; and when at a later time she inquired about
him for herself, she could never find any one who
had read his book, but scores who could “make
great argument about it and about,” or write sentimental
pamphlets on supposed Malthusian subjects.
This carelessness was not confined to the general
public; it infected the savants. Nothing more
clearly shows how political economy, or at least
one question of it, had descended into the streets
and become a common recreation. Even Nassau
William Senior, perhaps the most distinguished
professor of political economy in his day, confessed
with penitence that he had trusted more to his ears
than to his eyes for a knowledge of Malthusian
doctrine, and had written a learned criticism, not
of the opinion of Mr. Malthus, but of that which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“the multitudes who have followed and the few who
have endeavoured to oppose” Mr. Malthus, have
assumed to be his opinion.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The “opinion” so imagined by Senior and the
multitude is still the current Malthusianism. A
Malthusian is supposed to forbid all marriage. Mr.
Malthus was supposed to believe that “the desire of
marriage, which tends to increase population, is a
stronger principle than the desire of bettering our
condition, which tends to increase subsistence.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> This
meant, as Southey said, that “God makes men and
women faster than He can feed them.” The old
adage was wrong then: Providence does not send
meat where He sends mouths; on the contrary, He
sends mouths wherever He sends meat, so that the
poor can never cease out of the land, for, however
abundant the food, marriage will soon make the
people equally abundant. It is a question of simple
division. A fortune that is wealth for one will not
give comfort to ten, or bare life to twenty. The
moral is, for all about to marry, “Don’t,” and for
all statesmen, “Don’t encourage them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This caricature had enough truth in it to save it
from instant detection, and its vitality is due to the
superior ease in understanding, and therefore greater
pleasure in hearing, a blank denial or a blank affirmation
as compared with the necessary qualifications of
a scientific statement. The truth must be told, however,
that Malthus and the rest of the learned world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>were by no means at utter discord. He always
treated a hostile economist as a possible ally. He
was carrying on the work of their common Founder.
In the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> he was inquiring into the
nature and causes of poverty, as Adam Smith had
inquired into the nature and causes of wealth. But
Malthus himself did not intend the one to be a mere
supplement to the other. He did not approach the
subject from a purely scientific side. He had not
devoted long years of travel and reflection to the preparation
of an economical treatise. Adam Smith had
written his <cite>Moral Sentiments</cite> seventeen years before
his greater work. When he wrote the latter he had
behind him an academical and literary reputation;
and he satisfied the just expectations of the public
by giving them, in the two quarto volumes of the
<cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, his full-formed and completely
digested conclusions and reasonings definitively expressed
(1776). Malthus, on the contrary, gained
his reputation by a bold and sudden stroke, well followed
up. His <cite>Essay</cite> was an anonymous pamphlet
in a political controversy, and was meant to turn
the light of political economy upon the political
philosophy of the day. Whatever the essay contained
over and above politics, and however far
afield the author eventually travelled in the later
editions, there is no doubt about the first origin of
the essay itself. It was not, as we are sometimes told,
that, being a kind-hearted clergyman, he set himself
to work to inquire whether after all it was right to
increase the numbers of the population without caring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>for the quality of it. In 1798 Malthus was no doubt
in holy orders and held a curacy at Albury; but he
seems never to have been more than a curate. The
Whigs offered him a living in his later years, but he
passed it to his son;<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> and we should be far astray if
we supposed his book no more than the “recreations
of a country parson.” “Parson” was in his case a
title without a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i> and Cobbett’s immortal nickname
is very unhappy.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> He had hardly more of the parson
than Condillac of the abbé. In 1798 Pitt’s Bill
for extending relief to large families, and thereby
encouraging population, was no doubt before the
country; but we owe the essay not to William Pitt,
but to William Godwin. The changed aspect of the
book in its later editions need not blind us to the
efficient cause of its first appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thomas Robert Malthus had graduated at Cambridge
as ninth wrangler in the year 1788, in the
twenty-second year of his age. In 1797, after gaining
a fellowship at Jesus College, he happened to spend
some time at his father’s house at Albury in Surrey.
Father and son discussed the questions of the day,
the younger man attacking Jacobinism, the elder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>defending it. Daniel Malthus had been a friend
and executor of Rousseau, and was an ardent believer
in human progress. Robert had written a Whig
tract, which he called <cite>The Crisis</cite>, in the year of
Pitt’s new loan and Napoleon’s Italian campaign
(1796); but he did not publish it, and his views
were yet in solution. We may be sure the two
men did not spare each other in debate. In the
words of the elder Malthus, Robert then, if at no
other time, “threw little stones” into his garden. An
old man must have the patience of Job if he can look
with calmness on a young man breaking his ideals.
But in this case he at least recognized the strength
of the slinger, and he bore him no grudge, though he
did not live to be won by the concessions of the second
essay (1803). That Robert, on his part, was not wanting
in respect, is shown by an indignant letter, written
in February, 1800, on his father’s death, in reply to
the supposed slight of a newspaper paragraph.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The fireside debates had in that year (1797)
received new matter. William Godwin, quondam
parson, journalist, politician, and novelist, whose
<cite>Political Justice</cite> was avowedly a “child of the
Revolution,”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> had written a new book, the <cite>Enquirer</cite>,
in which many of his old positions were set in a
new light. The father made it a point of honour
to defend the <cite>Enquirer</cite>; the son played devil’s advocate,
partly from conviction, partly for the sake of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>argument; and, as often happens in such a case,
Robert found his case stronger than he had thought.
Hard pressed by an able opponent, he was led, on
the spur of the moment, to use arguments which had
not occurred to him before, and of which <cite>The Crisis</cite>
knows nothing. In calmer moments he followed
them up to their conclusions. “The discussion,” he
tells us,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> “started the general question of the future
improvement of society, and the author at first sat
down with an intention of merely stating his thoughts
to his friend upon paper in a clearer manner than
he thought he could do in conversation.” But the
subject opened upon him, and he determined to
publish. This is the plain story of the publication of
the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>, reduced to its simplest terms.
At the very time when the best men in both worlds
were talking only of progress, Malthus saw rocks
ahead. French and English reformers were looking
forward to a golden age of perfect equality and
happiness; Malthus saw an irremovable difficulty
in the way, and he refused to put the telescope
to his blind eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>There had been Cassandras before Malthus, and
even in the same century. Dr. John Bruckner of
Norwich had written in the same strain in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Théorie
du Système Animal</span></cite>, in 1767;<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and a few years earlier
(in 1761) Dr. Robert Wallace, writing of the <cite>Various
Prospects of Mankind, Nature, and Providence</cite>, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>talked of community of goods as a cure for the ills
of humanity, and then had found, very reluctantly,
one fatal objection—the excessive population that
would ensue. Men are always inclined to marry
and multiply their numbers till the food is barely
enough to support them all. This objection had
since Wallace’s time become a stock objection, to
be answered by every maker of Utopias. It was left
for Malthus to show the near approach which this
difficulty makes to absolute hopelessness, and to
throw the burden of proof on the other side. As
the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> altered the standing presumption
in favour of interference to one in favour
of liberty in matters of trade, so the <cite>Essay on
Population</cite> altered the presumption in favour of the
advocates of progress to a presumption against them.
This may not describe the final result of the essay,
but it is a true account of its immediate effect.
People had heard of the objection before; it was only
now that they began to look on it as conclusive.</p>

<p class='c007'>How had Godwin tried to meet it, when it was
still in the hands of weaker men, and therefore not
at all conclusive? He could not ignore it. In his
<cite>Political Justice</cite> (1793) he had given the outlines of
a “simple form of society, without government,” on
the principle of Tom Paine, which was also a received
Jacobin motto, “Society is produced by our wants,
government by our wickedness.”<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> He says, with the
ruling philosophy, that man is born a blank, and his
outward circumstances make him good or evil.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Thanks to human institutions, especially lawyers,
sovereigns, and statesmen, the outward circumstances,
he says, are as bad as they can be. Everywhere
there is inequality. There is great poverty alongside
of great riches, and great tyranny with great slavery.
In the same way the best of his novels, <cite>Caleb Williams</cite>
(1794), tells us how “things as they are” enable the
rich sinner to persecute the poor righteous man. But
he is no pessimist. The <cite>Political Justice</cite> does not
end with a statement of evils. It goes on to show
that in the end truth will conquer; men will listen
to reason, they will abandon their present laws, and
they will form a society without law or government
or any kind of force; no such things will be needed
when every man listens to reason, and contents
himself with plain living and high thinking. There
will be no king in Israel; every man will do that
which is right in his own eyes. In our present
society, says Godwin, it is distribution and not
production that is at fault. There is more than
enough of wealth for all, but it is not shared amongst
all. One man has too much, another little or nothing.
In the new society reason will change all that.
Reason tells us that, if we make an equal division,
not only of the good things of this life, but of the
labour of making them, then we shall secure a production
quite sufficient for the needs of plain livers,
at the cost of perhaps half-an-hour’s labour in a day
from each of them.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Each of them will, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>have leisure, which is the true riches, and he will
use the time for his own moral and intellectual
improvement. In this way, by the omnipotence of
truth and the power of persuasion, not by any
violence or power of the sword, perfection and
happiness will in time be established on the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Godwin made no essential change in these views
in the later editions of the <cite>Political Justice</cite> (1796
and 1798), or in the <cite>Enquirer</cite> (1797). “Among the
faithless, faithful only he,” when the excesses of the
Terror made even Sir James Mackintosh (not to say
Bishop Watson, Southey, and Wordsworth) a lukewarm
reformer. Nothing in Godwin’s life is more
admirable than the perfect confidence with which
he holds fast to his old faith in democratic principles
and the perfectibility of man. If it is obstinacy,
it is very like devotion; and perhaps the only
author who shows an equal constancy is Condorcet,
the Girondist, marked out for death, and writing
in his hiding-place, almost under the eyes of the
Convention, his eager book on the <cite>Progress of the
Species</cite>. Nothing but intense sincerity and sheer
depth of conviction could have enabled these men
to continue the defence of a dishonoured cause.
They had not the martyr’s greatest trial, the
doubt whether he is right. The great impression
made by their works was a sign that, as they felt
strongly, they wrote powerfully. Malthus, who
refuted both of them, apologized for giving serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>criticism to Condorcet’s palpable extravagances by
saying that Condorcet has many followers who will
hold him unanswerable unless he is specially answered.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
Of Godwin, Mr. Sumner, writing in 1816, says that
though his book (the <cite>Political Justice</cite>) was becoming
out of date, it was still “the ablest and best known
statement” of the doctrines of equality that had ever
appeared in England.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> It has been justly called the
“first text-book of the philosophical radicals.” The
actual effect of it cannot be measured by the number
of copies sold on its first appearance. Godwin had
placed it far beyond the reach of ordinary democrats
by fixing the price at three guineas. In 1793 many
who would have been his keenest readers could not
have paid three shillings for it. But the event
proved him wise in his generation. The Privy
Council decided they might safely tolerate so dear
a book; and a small audience even of the rich was
better to Godwin than prosecution, which might
mean exile and no audience at all.<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Few writers
of our own day have so good an excuse for making
themselves inaccessible to the poor. Godwin, however,
like Ruskin, reached the poor in spite of his
arrangements for avoiding them. He filtered down
among the masses; and his writings became a
political as well as a literary power in England,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>long before he had a poetic son-in-law to give him
reflected glory. If a species is to be judged by its
best individual, then Godwin represents better than
Paine the class of political writers to which they both
belong; and many fell down with Godwin when he
fell down before Malthus.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Enquirer</cite> was less popular than the <cite>Political
Justice</cite>. Part of the charm of the latter undoubtedly
lay in the elaborate completeness and systematic
order of the whole discussion. The foundations were
laid in the psychology of Locke; and then the building
was raised, stone by stone, until the whole was
finished. But in the <cite>Enquirer</cite> Godwin’s dislike of
law had extended even to the form of composition.
He had been wrong, he said, in trying to write a
systematic treatise on society, and he would now
confine himself to detached essays, wholly experimental,
and not necessarily in harmony with one
another. “He (the author) has carried this principle
so far that he has not been severely anxious relative
to inconsistency that may be discovered between the
speculations of one essay and the speculations of
another.”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The contrast between these two styles is
the contrast between a whole oratorio and a miscellaneous
concert, or between a complete poem and a
volume of extracts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The thoughts were the same, though they had lost
their attractive expression. The essay on <cite>Avarice
and Profusion</cite><a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> tells us, among other things, that “a
state of cultivated equality is that state which, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>speculation and theory, appears most consonant to
the nature of man, and most conducive to the extensive
diffusion of felicity.” This was the essay which
led Malthus and his father into their fruitful argument.
The essay on <cite>Riches and Poverty</cite>, and the one
on <cite>Beggars</cite>,<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> contain other applications of the same
idea, with many moralizing digressions. Godwin has
not lost his sweet Utopian vision; he has not yielded
to the objections that baffled Dr. Robert Wallace; he
thinks he has removed all objections.</p>

<p class='c007'>He meets them<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a> by saying first of all: “There is a
principle in the nature of human society by means of
which everything seems to tend to its level,” when not
interfered with; and the population of a country when
left to itself does not seem to increase beyond the food.
But in the second place, supposing things not to find
their level in this way, the earth is wide and the evil
day is far off. It may take myriads of centuries to
till the untilled acres and to replenish the empty
earth with people, and much may happen before then.
In fact, he views the subject as many of us view the
question of our coal supply. Before it is exhausted
we may be beyond the need of it.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> The earth itself
may have collapsed with all its inhabitants. Don’t
let us refuse a present blessing from fear of a remote
future danger. Besides, it is not very hard to
imagine a safeguard. Franklin says that “mind
will one day become omnipotent over matter;”<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a> why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>not over the matter of our own bodies? Does not
the bodily health depend largely on the mind?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A merry heart goes all the day;</div>
      <div class='line'>Your sad tires in a mile, O!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The time may come when we shall be so full of
liveliness that we shall not sleep, and so full of life
that we shall not die. The <em>need</em> for marriage will
be superseded by earthly immortality, and the <em>desire</em>
for it by the development of intellect. On the
renewed earth of the future there will be neither
marrying nor giving in marriage, but we shall be
as the angels. “The whole will be a people of men,
and not of children. Generation will not succeed
generation, nor truth have, in a certain degree, to
recommence her career every thirty years. Other
improvements may be expected to keep pace with
those of health and longevity. There will be no
war, no crimes, no administration of justice as it is
called, and no government. Besides this, there will
be neither disease, anguish, melancholy, nor resentment.
Every man will seek with ineffable ardour
the good of all.”<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This sweet strain had been enchanting the public
for four or five years, when Malthus ventured to
interrupt it with his modest anonymous <cite>Essay on
the Principle of Population as it affects the Future
Improvement of Society</cite>. The writer claims to be
as hearty a philanthropist as Mr. Godwin, but he
cannot allow the wish to be father to the thought,
and believe in future perfection against evidence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>To prove a theory true, he says, it is not enough
to show that you cannot prove its contradiction,
or that you can prove its usefulness. It would be
very useful to have eyes in both sides of our head;
but that does not prove that we are going to have
them. If you told me that man was becoming a
winged creature like the ostrich, I should not doubt
that he would find wings very useful, but I could
hardly believe your prophecy without some kind of
proof beyond the mere praises of flying. I should
ask you to show palpable signs in his body and
habits that such a change was going on, that his
neck has been lengthening, his lips hardening, and
his hair becoming feathery. In the same way, when
you tell me that man is becoming a purely intellectual
being, content with plain living and high
thinking, I see there might be advantage in the
change, but I ask for signs that it is in progress.
I see none; but, on the contrary, I see strong reasons
for believing in its impossibility. Grant me two
postulates, and I disprove your millennium. The
first is, that food is necessary; the second, that the
instinct for marriage is permanent. No one denies
the first, and Godwin’s denial of the second is purely
dogmatic. He has given us no proofs. Men have
no doubt made progress in other respects; they
have passed from barbarism to civilization. But in
respect of the second postulate they are the same
now as they were 4000 years ago. Individual
exceptions are individual exceptions still. I am
bound, therefore, to believe in the truth of my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>postulates, and I infer from them the impossibility of
your millennium.</p>

<p class='c007'>You speak of a society, he continues, where the
members are all equally comfortable and at leisure.
Suppose it established, it could not last; it would
go to pieces through the principle of population
alone. The seven years of plenty would be at
once devoured by seven years of want. The proof of
this is short and decisive:—Population, when unchecked,
increases in a geometrical ratio; subsistence
only in an arithmetical. “A slight acquaintance
with numbers will show the immensity of the first
power in comparison with the second.”<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> “The race
of plants and animals shrinks under this great
restrictive law, and the race of man cannot by any
efforts of reason escape from it. Among plants and
animals its effects are waste of seed, sickness, and
premature death, among men misery and vice,” the
former necessary, the latter probable. Now, in the
old countries of Europe, population never is unchecked.
It is checked by want of room and food.
Vice and misery, and the fear of them, are always
“equalizing” the numbers of the people with the
food of the people. In the New World, “the
cynosure of neighbouring eyes,” there are fewer
hindrances to early marriage; there is more room and
there is more food; hard work is the only condition
of a happy life. But, even there, population is not
entirely unchecked; the hard work will at least
interfere with the rearing of children; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>people, however comfortable, are not at the very
highest pitch of comfort, or at the highest pitch of
purity and simplicity of life; whereas, by assumption,
Godwin’s imaginary society is all these. If,
therefore, the people of old Europe double their
numbers once a century, and the people of new
America (at least in the United States) once in
twenty-five years, we may be sure that in the
millennial society of Godwin,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Where all are proper and well-behaved,</div>
      <div class='line'>And all are free from sorrow and pain,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>the increase would be much faster. The “leisure”
he talks of would soon disappear, and the old scramble
for bread, the old inequality of rank and property,
would again become the order of the day. We should
have our own kind of society back again, with its
masters and servants, landlords and tenants, rich and
poor.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore (argues the writer of the essay) if
Godwin’s society were once made it could not last.
But we grant too much in supposing it could ever
be made. We cannot believe this and believe in the
second postulate at the same time; and the second
postulate is so certain that we can predict by it.
The same causes, then, that would have destroyed
Godwin’s newly-formed society will prevent it from
ever being formed at all. “The passion between
the sexes has appeared in every age to be so nearly
the same that it may always be considered, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>algebraic language, as a given quantity.”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> In spite
of the whimpering of old men and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">roués</span></i>, “the
pleasures of pure love will bear the contemplation
of the most improved reason and the most exalted
virtue.”<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> Godwin views the matter in a dry, intellectual
light, and asks us to abstract from all accessories
before we form an estimate of the passion in
question. One man or one woman will then be as
good as another. But he might as well tell us to
strip off all the leaves before we estimate our liking
for trees. We do not admire the bare pole, but the
whole tree, the tree with all the “attendant circumstances”
of branches and foliage. As well deprive
a magnet of its chief powers of attraction, and then
ask us to confess it as weak as other minerals.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The
fact is, that man’s large discourse, which marks him
out from the brutes, makes him hide the marriage
instinct under a mass of “attendant circumstances”
before he lets himself be drawn by it. He will not
obey the instinct simply <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">more feræ</span></i>, or in animal
fashion, because he feels it. But it is not destroyed,
only disguised. The love is not purely intellectual.
Reason, with its calculation of consequences, can
save a man from the abuse of a passion, but cannot
destroy the passion itself;<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a> and (he might have
added) its “looking before and after” includes fancy
as well as thought. Take this passion then as it
is, an adoration it may be of an assemblage of accessories;
it can never die out of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>From this cheerful premise, what conclusion
follows? One not altogether cheerful: Wherever
Providence sends meat He will send mouths.
Wherever the people have room and food, they will
marry and multiply their numbers, till they press
against the limits of both, and begin a fierce struggle
for existence, in which death is the punishment of
defeat. Godwin and the whole French school are
sadly wrong in attributing all inequality to human
institutions; human nature is to blame, and, without
any artificial aid, this one passion of human nature
will be the standing cause of inequality, the most
serious obstacle to the removal of it.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Dr. Robert
Wallace had more wisdom than he wot of.</p>

<p class='c007'>Examine the meaning of this argument and its
conclusion. It involves an answer to Godwin’s first
defence against Wallace. Here is something very
like a law of nature, a truth past, present, and future,
or, in other words, a truth which, being scientific,
ought not to be stated in terms of time at all:
“Where goods increase, they are increased that eat
them.” The “struggle for existence” (Malthus uses
the very phrase) is a present fact, as it has been a
past fact, and will be a future. No good is gained
by rhetorical references to the wideness of the world
and the possibilities of the ages.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a> In our own day
and land we see people multiplying up to the limit of
the food, and a “great restrictive law” preventing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>them, as it prevents all other animals, from multiplying
beyond that limit.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> In our own day and country,
men marry when they cannot support a family; the
children whom they cannot support die of hunger or
sickness, if the charity of the public does not interfere;—or
else the fear of misery makes men avoid a marriage
for which they have not the means, and their
celibacy, whether pure or impure, keeps the numbers
of the people on a level with the food.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Godwin
himself had written in so many words: “There is a
principle in human society by which population is
perpetually kept down to the level of the means of
subsistence.”<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Why did he not take one step more,
and discover what that principle is?<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The fact is that Godwin was at once intellectually
sanguine and emotionally cold. His ideal would
have been a man “of large brain and no affections;”
and when he wrote the <cite>Political Justice</cite> he was not
aware of his own defect. At a later time he was not
only aware of it, but anxious to remove it. In his
Memoir of his wife, Mary Wollstonecraft (1798), and
in the story of <cite>St. Leon</cite> (1799), the man who found
the philosopher’s stone, and became, to his own
sorrow, immortal on earth, he confesses that he has
hitherto taken too little thought of feeling as an
element in human action. If Mary had been too
much of a Werther, her husband had been too little.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Like Condorcet (and like Buckle), he had believed
civilization to be a purely intellectual movement.
He had dogmatized on the omnipotence of truth
and reason, and inferred the growth of a perfect
society. He had dogmatized on the development of
intellect, and inferred an earthly immortality. Moreover,
in the <cite>Memoir</cite>, and in <cite>St. Leon</cite>, if he had
added a little to his doctrines, he had recanted little
or nothing, even in regard to immortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>St. Leon is miserable only because his gift is
peculiar to himself; an immortality that is common
to all would be acceptable to all. A Methuselah
would not be melancholy among antediluvians. Such
was probably Godwin’s position. The mere belief
in the possibility of earthly immortality was not
uncommon; Godwin is careful to number Bacon
among its supporters.<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Malthus was probably right
in tracing it to the unconscious influence of Christianity,<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a>
though the progress in Godwin’s days of the
new science of chemistry had perhaps more to do
with it, and Godwin’s religion was never more than
a bare Theism.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a>  It was held by Holcroft, one of
Godwin’s most intimate friends,<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a> and it was an
important part of Condorcet’s <cite>Sketch of the Progress
of the Human Spirit</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the days of the Terror (1794) Condorcet, from
his hiding-place in the Rue Servandoni, had written
of the “organic perfectibility of man.” He looked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to medicine, and to the arts and sciences in general,
to banish disease and prolong human life “indefinitely.”<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a>
Godwin trusted to the inward development
of the mind, not to outward appliances.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a> But by
different ways they arrive at the same terminus, and
receive from their great critic very much the same
reception there. Malthus points out to Godwin that
there is no sign that the body is becoming subjugated
to the mind. Even philosophers, said he (and he
wrote feelingly, as he had the malady at the time of
writing), cannot endure the toothache patiently,<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a> and
even a merry heart will not enable a weak man to
walk as fast and as far as a strong man. There
is no change in the human body, and little or no
change in the relation of the mind to it. To Condorcet
he simply points out that, while the arts have
made the lengthening of life “indefinite,” that does
not mean “infinite.” Gardeners can grow carnations
“indefinitely” large; no man can ever say that he
has seen the largest carnation that will ever be
grown; but this he can say, that a carnation will
never be as large as a cabbage. The limit is there,
though it is undefined, and there is a limit also to
the lengthening of human life, though no one can
fix it to a year. Condorcet therefore has proved an
earthly immortality only by a misuse of the word
“indefinite.” He has shown no organic change in
man which would prove the possibility of perfection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>in this world. Neither has Condorcet repelled the
objection which troubled Dr. Wallace. It is true
that, like Godwin, he faces the difficulty and admits
the importance of it.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> The growth of population
will always, he says, cause inequality; there will
always be a rich leisured class and a poor industrial
class; and to lighten the hardships of the latter
there ought to be a State Insurance fund, which
will make all the poorest citizens sure of support.
But one cannot help thinking, if all are sure of
support, all will marry, and if all marry, will not
the difficulty be increased?<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Yes, Condorcet grants
this; the numbers will soon be too great, and so
throughout the ages there will be an “oscillation”
between the blessings of progress and the evils of
overcrowding, now the one predominating, now the
other. In despair he clutches at the old fallacy,
“the day is distant,” but he feels it fail him, and
must needs add a new and startling solution of his
own which Malthus freely denounces.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a> This is not
the place to discuss the questions associated in our
own times with Neo-Malthusianism.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a> But it is
beyond all doubt that the Neo-Malthusians are the
children not of Robert Malthus, but of Robert Owen.
Malthus was not Malthus because he said, “The
people are too many; thin them down”—any more
than Darwin was Darwin because he said, “Species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>are not made, but grow.” If Darwinians are to be
judged by Darwin, Malthusians must be judged by
Malthus; and the originality of neither Malthus nor
Darwin can be explained by a single phrase. We
cannot understand the meaning of an author’s words,
far less of his work, till we know the context in which
they are set. Once know the context and we understand
the text. The devil, citing Scripture for his
purpose, only succeeds because he never quotes in full.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows that, to understand the full meaning
of the essay, we must go beyond its efficient cause,
and take a view of its material cause, or the whole
circumstances in which it was written. If the text
of the sermon was Godwin and Condorcet, the
application was to the poor of England and the
philanthropists who were trying to relieve them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The early life of Malthus, coinciding, as it largely
does, with the latter half of the eighteenth century,
coincides with England’s greatest industrial revolution.
Malthus was born in 1766, three years after the Peace
of Paris. There was an end, for the time, to foreign
wars, and trade was making a brave start. The
discoveries of coal and iron in Northern England,
going hand in hand with the inventions of cotton-spinning
and weaving, were beginning to convert the
poorest counties into the richest, upsetting the
political balance. The new science of chemistry had
begun to prove its usefulness. Wedgwood was perfecting
his earthenware, Brindley cutting his canals,
Telford laying out his roads, Watt building his steam-engines.
England in Roman days had been a granary;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>in later ages she had been a pasture-ground; she was
now becoming the land of machinery and manufacture,
as well as the centre of foreign trade. In other words,
she had begun an industrial change, which was the
greatest till then in her history, and rich in the most
magical improvements. But in the early stages of
the change, the evils of it were nearly as much felt
as the blessings. The sufferings of displaced workmen,
and the anarchy of the new factory system, supplanting
home labour, and making the word “manufacturer”
forget its etymology,<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a> were real evils,
however transient. Combined with the general
democratic influence of an expansive manufacturing
industry, they might easily have caused a social
convulsion in these days of no extraordinary virtue;
and the country owed its escape in some degree to
the evangelical movement under Whitefield and the
Wesleys, which was fatal at once to religious torpor
and to political excitement.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> The annoyances of a
meddlesome tariff and the futile attempts to exclude
foreign food were to vanish away before a hundred
years had passed; but in the boyhood of Malthus
the voice of Adam Smith raised against them in the
<cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> (1776) was a cry in the wilderness.
There was a general agreement that, whether the high
prices prevailing after the Peace of Paris were caused
by the growth of the population, or by the lessened
value of silver, or by the troubles in Poland, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>remedy was not to lie in a free corn trade. The poor
were not to have cheap corn, they were to have large
allowances. Legislation had gone backwards in this
matter. In 1723 a new law had introduced a wise
workhouse test of destitution, which might have prevented
wilful poverty by reducing outdoor relief; but
the clause was repealed by Gilbert’s Act in 1782; the
poor were to be “set on work” at their own houses;
and the new stringency gave place to the old laxity,
with the usual results. The close of the century saw
the troubles of a European war added to the list, and
the tide of political reform ebbed for forty years
(1792–1832). Because the French reform had gone
too far, the English reform was not allowed to take
its first steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a commonplace with historians that the French
Revolution would have been very different without
Voltaire and Rousseau to prepare the way for it.
Hunger and new ideas are two advocates of change
which always plead best in each other’s company;
hunger makes men willing to act, and the new ideas
give them matter for enactment. In France, when
the crisis came in 1789, the new ideas were not far
to seek. Writers of Utopias, from Plato to More,
and from Rousseau to Ruskin, have always adopted
one simple plan: they have struck out the salient
enormities of their own time and inserted the
opposite, as when men imagine heaven they think
of their dear native country with its discomforts left
out. Inequality at home had made Frenchmen ready
to dote on a vision of equality when Rousseau
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>presented it to them, and the state of Nature was
the state of France reversed. Philosophically, the
theorists of the Revolution traced their descent to
Locke, and their ideas were not long in recrossing the
Channel to visit their birthplace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even if Englishmen had not had in America a
visible Utopia, or, at least, Arcadia, there was hunger
enough in England to recommend the new ideas to
every rank in society. This is the reason why, in
1793, Godwin’s book was so successful. It was not
only a good English statement of the French doctrines
of equality, and therefore a book for the times, but
it had a vigour of its own, and was no mere translation.
Rousseau and Raynal had thought it necessary
to sacrifice universal improvement to universal
equality; they saw (or thought they saw) that the
two could not go together, and they counted equality
so desirable that they were willing to purchase it at
the expense of barbarism. Now, they were perhaps
more logical than Godwin; equality may mean barbarism.
But Godwin’s ideal was at least higher than
theirs; he thought of civilization and equality as
quite compatible, for he thought that when all men
were truly civilized they would of their own accord
restore equality. As he left everything to reason and
nothing to force, his book was in theory quite harmless;
but the tendency of it seemed dangerous, for it
criticized the British constitution in a free way to
which the British nation was not accustomed. In
England, moreover, the people have always confounded
ideas with persons. They were not in love with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>liberty when it took the form of an American “War
of Independence” against England, and, even if
equality had pleased them in 1789, they would have
nothing of it after the Terror. They forsook Fox for
Burke, and went to war for a sentiment. At the
time when Malthus wrote, the bulk of the English
people had lost their enthusiasm for the new ideas.
It needed some fortitude to call oneself a Reformer,
or even a Whig, when Napoleon had overrun Italy
and was facing us in Egypt. Pitt held all persons
seditious who did not believe in the wisdom of the war.</p>

<p class='c007'>But even Pitt, though he now ignored the need of
reform, could not overlook the existence of distress.
In 1795 there had been a serious scarcity; war prices
had become famine prices. It was the year when
“the lower orders” were held down by special coercion
acts;<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a> it was the year when the king’s carriage
was stopped by a mob crying “Bread, bread!” Mr.
Whitbread and the rest thought Parliament ought to
“do something”; and Pitt proposed (1796) to meet
the difficulty by amending the Poor Laws. His
bill proposed “to restore the original purity of the
Poor Laws” by modifying the law of settlement in
the direction of greater freedom, and by assisting the
working man in other ways. One of these other
ways was an attempt of a harmless kind to found
schools of industry, another to attach every labourer
to a friendly society. But another less innocently
proposed to encourage the growth of population by
making the poor relief greater where the family was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>larger. “Let us make relief,” in such cases, “a
matter of right and honour, instead of a ground for
opprobrium and contempt. This will make a large
family a blessing and not a curse; and this will
draw a proper line of distinction between those who
are to provide for themselves by their labour, and
those who, after enriching their country with a
number of children, have a claim upon its assistance
for their support.”<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus in 1796 did not doubt the infallibility of
Pitt in such a matter; <cite>The Crisis</cite> gives no hint of
objection. But in 1798, with his new light, he could
no longer take the recruiting officer’s view of population.
If he had had a good case against Godwin and
Condorcet, who had simply failed to show how population
could be kept from growing too fast, he had
still a better case against Pitt, who proposed to make
it grow faster. Besides, their schemes were merely
on paper; they had no chance of realizing them,
whereas Pitt’s majority would carry any measure on
which he had set his heart. The danger from this
third quarter was therefore the most imminent. But
Malthus needed no new argument for it; he needed
simply to shift round his old argument, and point the
muzzle of it at his new enemy. There is no need, he
said, to encourage marriage; there is no need for
Government to make population grow faster. Wherever
Providence has sent meat, He will soon send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>mouths to eat it; and, if by your artificial encouragements
you increase the mouths without increasing the
meat, you will only bring the people one step nearer
starvation, you will only multiply the nation without
increasing the joy. If stalwart numbers are strength,
starving numbers are weakness.<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>These commonplaces were then a paradox. Even
at the end of the eighteenth century there was no
party in the English House of Commons identified
with enlightened views on the position of the British
workman. Whitbread had always some measure on
hand for helping the labourer out of the rates, or by
some other State interference; it was in opposing
one of Whitbread’s bills that the Prime Minister
promised to introduce his own memorable measure.
Fox was free to follow either, not professing to understand
the new economical doctrines. Pitt, who
admired Adam Smith,—Fox, Condorcet, and Godwin,
who owed Smith no allegiance,<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a>—all were equally
purblind in this matter. All Pitt’s study of the
fourth book of the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, chapter fifth,
had not shown him the fallacy of a bounty on
children. Yet Malthus had got his light from no
obscure sources, but from “Hume, Wallace, Adam
Smith, and Dr. Price,”<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c016'><sup>[52]</sup></a> who were all well-known and
widely-read authors of the day. “The populousness
of ancient nations” had been a happy hunting-ground
for learned antiquarian essay writers over half a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>century. Montesquieu, Wallace, and Price<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c016'><sup>[53]</sup></a> claimed
the advantage for the ancients. David Hume, with
his usual acute divination, decides for the moderns,
though with his usual irony he professes to adopt a
sceptical conclusion, and makes several concessions
to Wallace.<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> This controversy itself might have been
expected to bring men nearer to the truth on the
subject of population than it actually did. It was
left to Malthus to convert Hume’s probability into
a certainty from a higher vantage-ground; but the
sifting of the arguments by the various writers
before him must have simplified his task.<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a> Other
aids and anticipations were not wanting. As early
as 1786, Joseph Townsend, the Wiltshire rector,
had written a <cite>Dissertation on the Poor Laws</cite>, which
gives an admirable statement of those wise views of
charity and poor relief that are only in these latter
days becoming current among us. Malthus records
his opinion of Townsend’s work in the best of all
possible ways. From his careful inquiry (in the
second edition of the <cite>Essay</cite>) into the population of
European countries, he omits Spain on the ground
that Mr. Townsend’s <cite>Travels in Spain</cite> has already
done the work for him.<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Essay on Population</cite> was therefore not original
in the sense of being a creation out of nothing, but
in the same way as the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>. In both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>cases the author got most of his phrases, and even
many of his thoughts, from his predecessors; but
he treated them as his predecessors were unable to
do; he saw them in their connection, perspective,
and wide bearings. We must not assume anticipation
where there is mere identity of language or
partial identity of thought; the words of an earlier
writer are not unfrequently quoted by a later away
from their logical context, and therefore not as part
of an argument of which the writer sees the consecutive
premises. This is true of Adam Smith when he
is compared with Sir Dudley North, Abraham Tucker,
or the other prophets of free trade<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> catalogued
by MacCulloch or Blanqui. They talked free trade
almost as Mons. Jourdain talked prose, without knowing
it. Precisely the same is true of Adam Smith
himself in relation to Malthus. Of his own generalizations
he is complete master. Having reasoned up
to them, he can reason down from them. But, when
he says, “Every species of animals naturally multiplies
in proportion to the means of their subsistence,”
“The demand for men necessarily regulates the production
of men,”<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a> he has not anticipated Malthus.
His phrases are touching a principle of which he does
not see the most important bearings; and not having
reasoned up to it, he makes hardly any attempt to
reason down from it. Malthus, on the other hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>has taken fast hold of a general principle, and is able
to solve a number of dependent questions in the way
of simple corollaries. Others may have given right
answers to the special questions about the Poor Law
and the populousness of ancient nations. Malthus is
the first to show one comprehensive reason why all
these answers must be right.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the secret of his success. As Godwin’s
<cite>Political Justice</cite> was successful because systematic,
the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> was successful because it
seemed to put chaos in order. The very sadness of
his conclusion had a charm for some minds; but the
bulk of his readers did not love him for taking their
hopes away, they loved him for giving them new
light. Pestilence and famine begin to lose their
vague terrors when we know whence they come and
what they do for the world. Even if the desire of
marriage is itself an evil, it is well to know the truth
about it. Ignorance can only be blissful where it is
total; and wilful ignorance, being of necessity partial,
is a perpetual unrest, not even a fool’s paradise.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The truth in this case was not all sadness. In the
last portion of the essay of 1798 Malthus expounds
an argument which he afterwards reproduced in
later editions with a more terrestrial application.
He uses the style of Paley and the Apologists, and
he tries to discover the final cause of the principle
of population, on metaphysical lines that
were followed by Mr. Sumner nearly twenty years
afterwards, when the discussion had taken a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>turn.<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a> The question is how to reconcile the suffering
produced by the principle of population with the
goodness of God. Malthus answers that the difficulty
is only one part of the general problem of evil, the
difference between this part and the rest being that
in this case we see farther into the causes; and it is
therefore the easier for us to justify the ways of God
to man. “Evil exists not to create despair but
activity.”<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c016'><sup>[61]</sup></a> We ought not to reason from God to
nature, but from nature to God; to know how God
works, let us observe how nature works. We shall then
find that nature sends all sentient creatures through
a long and painful process, by which they gain new
qualities and powers, presumably fitting them for
a better place than they have in this world. This
world and this life are therefore in all probability
“the mighty process of God,” not indeed for the mere
“probation” of man (for that would imply that his
Maker was suspicious of him, or ignorant of what was
in him), but for the “creation and formation” of
the human mind out of the torpor and corruption of
dead matter,<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a> “to sublimate the dust of the earth
into soul, to elicit an ethereal spark from the clod of
clay.” The varied influences of life are the forming
hand of the Creator, and they are infinitely diverse,
for (in spite of Solomon) there is nothing old under
the sun.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c016'><sup>[63]</sup></a> Difficulties generate talents.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c016'><sup>[64]</sup></a> “The first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>awakeners of the mind are the wants of the body;”
it is these that rouse the intellect of the infant and
sharpen the wits of the savage. Not leisure but
necessity is the mother of invention:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Locke was right; the desire to avoid pain is even
stronger than the desire to find pleasure. In this
way evil leads to good; for pain, which is a kind of
evil, creates effort, and effort creates mind. This is
the general rule. A particular example of it is, that
want of food, which is one of the most serious of
evils, leads to good. By contriving that the earth
shall produce food only in small quantities, and in
reward of labour, God has provided a perpetual spur
to human progress. This is the key to the puzzle
of population. By nature man is a lotos-eater till
hunger makes him a Ulysses. Why should he toil,
the roof and crown of things? Mainly because, if he
does not toil, neither can he live; the lotos country
will soon be over-peopled, and he must push off his
bark again. “The first awakeners of the mind are
the wants of the body,” though, once awakened, the
mind soon finds out wants beyond the body, and the
development of intellect and civilization goes on
indefinitely.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a> The people “tend to increase” more
quickly than their food, not in order that men may
suffer, but in order that they may be roused to save
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>themselves from suffering. The partial ill of all
such general laws is swallowed up in the general
good; and the general good is secured in two ways:
humanity is developed; the resources of the world
are developed. In the first place, the intellect of
individual men is developed, for the constancy of
nature is the foundation of reasoning, and human
reason would never be drawn out unless men were
absolutely unable to depend on miracles, and were
obliged as well as able to make calculations on the
basis of a constant law. To this constancy of nature
we owe the immortal mind of a Newton. In the second
place, the world must be peopled. If savages could
have got all their food from one central spot of fertile
ground, the earth at large would have remained
a wilderness; but, as it is, no one settlement can
support an indefinite increase of numbers; the
numbers must spread out over the earth till they
find room and food. If there were no law of increase,
a few such careers as Alexander’s or Tamerlain’s
might unpeople the whole world; but the law
exists, and the gaps made by any conqueror, or by any
pestilence, are soon filled to overflowing, while the
overflowing flood passes on to reclaim new countries.<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This is the cosmology of Malthus. “Life is,
generally speaking, a blessing independent of a future
state.”<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> “The impressions and excitements of this
world are the instruments with which the Supreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Being forms matter into mind.” The necessity of constant
exertion, to avoid evil and pursue good, is the
principal spring of these impressions, and is therefore
a sufficient reason for the existence of natural and
moral evil, including the difficulties which arise from
the principle of population. All these are present
difficulties, but they are not beyond remedy. They
do not serve their purpose unless human exertion
succeeds in diminishing them. Absolute removal
Malthus does not promise; but, while believing in
science and reason as strongly as Condorcet or
Godwin, declines to regard an earthly immortality as
a reasonable hope, and points us instead to a future life
and to another world for perfection and happiness.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps the great economist went beyond his province
in attacking the problem of evil. In the
controversy that followed the essay there are few
references to this part of it, and after the appearance
of the second edition, where this part is omitted
altogether, people forgot the existence of the first
edition. From the way in which Sumner speaks of
the difference between his point of view and that
of Malthus, it might fairly be suspected that he
knew nothing of the first edition; and yet the
second of his two learned volumes is simply an
expansion of its ideas.<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a> The metaphysic itself might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>be deep or shallow; it would be impossible to tell
till we heard the sense in which the metaphysical
phrases were used, and that we have hardly any
means of doing. They point at least to the
“monistic” view, that there is no gulf between mind
and matter. We might believe them idealistic in a
German sense; but we cannot forget how closely the
ethical views of Malthus are connected with those of
the English moralists of his century. He cannot be
said to have a place in the history of philosophy;
and it is mainly of a curious personal interest to
discover that, although he is nominally a utilitarian,
he separates himself from Paley by refusing to
allow moral value to action done from either fear of
punishment or hope of reward.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a> There is no indication
that he was a metaphysical genius. His
researches in the heavier German literature did not
perhaps extend much farther than to the quaint
optimist Johann Peter Süssmilch,<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a> from whose
<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Göttliche Ordnung</span></cite> he freely drew his statistics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus at one time intended to expound his
metaphysical views at greater length.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a> In other
words, he meant to write a book in the manner of
Price’s essays, half economical and half literary. We
need not deeply regret the “particular business,”
whatever it was, that nipped this intention in the
bud, besides delaying the publication of the essay as
we now have it.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a> The metaphysical and theological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>passages, as they stand, have the look of an episode,
though the thought of them is logically enough connected
with the tenor of the book. The views of
the author on the other world, the punishment of
the wicked, and the use of miracles, have, like the
philosophy, mainly a personal interest. Adam Smith,
in the later edition of his <cite>Moral Sentiments</cite>, had
omitted at least one very marked expression of theological
opinion (on the Atonement) that had appeared
in the first edition,<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a> and perhaps his disciple did
well to follow suit. At the same time, omission is
not recantation, and we get light on an author’s
mind and character by discovering any views in which
he once professed to believe. A writer who reached
absolute truth at a very early stage of study, has
patronized Adam Smith<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a> by editing his chief work,
and honoured the other economists by tabulating
their conclusions in an historical introduction. He
extends this favour to Malthus. The reasonings of
Malthus he finds, though valuable, are not free from
error; he has “all but entirely overlooked” the
beneficial effects of the principle of population as a
stimulus to invention and progress.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a> This charge is
refuted by the essay even in its later form; but,
placed alongside of the cosmology of the first edition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>it seems merely grotesque. Malthus is accused of
ignoring the very phenomena which Malthus glorifies
as the “final cause” of the principle of population.
He thought he had explained not only one of the
chief causes of poverty, but one of the chief effects;
if Adam Smith had shown the power of labour as
a cause of wealth, Malthus thought he had shown the
power of poverty as a cause of labour. No doubt
the mistake was a common one; and (to say nothing
of the encyclopædias and biographical dictionaries)
there are few economical text-books which do justice
to Malthus in this matter.<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a> But one who speaks
with authority should not be content with a borrowed
knowledge. The same authority tells us that “the
work of Mr. Malthus is valuable rather for having
awakened public attention to the subject than for
its giving anything like a complete view of the department
of the science of which it treats.”<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c016'><sup>[78]</sup></a> Malthus
for his part lays no claim to infallibility; like most
pioneers, he is sure of little beyond his leading
principles, and he is never ashamed to change his
views.<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c016'><sup>[79]</sup></a> But, if his <cite>Essay on Population</cite>, gradually
amended and expanded as it was, to keep pace with
the searching criticisms of thirty years, has not
reached the heart of the matter, surely there is no
profit in discussion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>The fact is, that though the anonymous small 8vo
of 1798 was a mere draught of the completed work
of later years, its main fault was not incompleteness,
but wrongness of emphasis. When a man is writing
a controversial pamphlet, he does not try to bring
all truths into the front equally; he sets the neglected
ones in the foreground, and allows the familiar
to fall behind, not as denied or ignored, but simply
as not emphasized. It is always possible, in such
cases, that the neglected truths, though unworthy
of the old neglect, did not deserve the new pre-eminence,
and must not be allowed to retain it. Science,
seeking answers to its own questions, and not to
questions of the eighteenth century, has no toleration
for the false emphasis of passing controversy. It
puts the real beginning first, the middle next, and
the end last, not the end in the middle, or the
last first. Accordingly it takes up the first essay
of Malthus on population, and requires the author
to amend it. He must be less critical and more
creative, if he is to give a satisfactory answer to the
general problem which he has chosen to take in hand.
The times and the subject, both, demand a change of
attitude,——the times, because political theories have
now become less important than social difficulties,
and the subject, because he has hitherto, while clearly
explaining the difficulties, done little more than hint
at the expedients for overcoming them. True, no
critic or iconoclast can ever fully vanquish an opponent
except by a truth of his own which goes beyond
the opponent’s falsity; and it is to this he owes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the enthusiasm of his followers. But he does not
always expound the truth so fully as the error; and
so, beyond the point of negation, his friends often
follow him rather by faith than by sight. This,
then, was what Malthus had yet to do; to state
what were the trustworthy as well as the delusive
methods of raising modern society, and what were
the right as well as the wrong ways of relieving
the poor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success of the essay, so far, had been very
remarkable. It had provoked replies by the dozen,
and an unwilling witness tells us it had converted
friends of progress by the hundred.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c016'><sup>[80]</sup></a> We find
Godwin writing to the author in August 1798,<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a> and
we may conclude that the veil of anonymousness was
not very thick, though Malthus used it again in 1800
in the tract on High Prices. In a debate in the
House of Commons on the 11th February, 1800,
Pitt took occasion to say that, though he still believed
his new Poor Bill a good one, he had dropped it in
deference to the objections of “those whose opinions
he was bound to respect.”<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a> He meant Bentham and
Malthus. We cannot tell which had the greater share
of the credit, but we know that Malthus regarded
Pitt and Paley as his most brilliant converts.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a> Pitt’s
declaration that he still believed his bill to be a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>one could only mean that he still wished to believe
it so. It must have been peculiarly galling to a
statesman who affected the political economist to
find that not only the solemn criticisms of Malthus,
but the jocose “Observations” of Bentham,<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a> which
threshed the chaff out of the bill clause by clause,
had turned his favourite science against himself.</p>

feature of the Second Essay—Its moderate Optimism—Rough
Classification of Checks—Moral Restraint and Mixed Motives—Freedom
as understood by Godwin and by Malthus—The two
men contrasted.</p>

<p class='c006'>While Malthus was making such converts as Pitt,
Paley, and Parr, and when even Godwin acknowledged
the “writer of the essay” to have made a
“valuable addition to political economy,”<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a> the essay
was not beyond criticism. There were some familiar
facts of which the writer had taken too little account,
and they were impressed on him by his critics from
all sides. To use the language of philosophy, he had
not been sufficiently concrete; he had gone far to
commit Godwin’s fault, and consider one feature of
human nature apart by itself, instead of seeing it in
its place with the rest. The position and prospects
of civilized society in our own day depend on a
combination of political, intellectual, physical, and
moral causes, of which the growth or decrease of
population may be only an effect. If we are part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>man, part lion, and part hog, it is not fair to assume
the predominance of the hog any more than the
predominance of the man. In a herd of animals, as
distinguished from a society of men, the units are
simply the fittest who have survived in the struggle
for existence. The principle of population is in the
foreground there; there is no check to it but famine,
disease, and death. We can therefore understand
how the study of the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> led Charles
Darwin to explain the origin of species by a generalization
which Malthus had known and named, though
he did not pursue it beyond man.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a> The “general
struggle” among animals “for room and food” means
among civilized men something very like free trade,
the old orthodox economical panacea for economic
evils; and the essayist agrees with Adam Smith in
a general resistance to legislative interference. Bad
as are the effects of the irremovable causes of poverty,
interference makes them still worse. But at least,
when we come to man, the struggle is not so cruel.
“Plague take the hindmost” is not the only or the
supreme rule. If the fear of starvation, the most
earthly and least intellectual of all motives, is needed
to force us to work at first, it need not therefore be
necessary ever afterwards. The baser considerations
are by their definition the lowest layers of our pile;
we rise by means of them, but we tread them down,
and the higher the pile the less their importance.
Within civilized countries, in proportion to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>civilization, the struggle in the lowest stages is
abolished; the weakest are often saved, and the
lowest raised, in spite of unfitness.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a> View man not
as an animal, but as a citizen; view the principle
of population as checked not only by vice, misery,
and the fear of them, but by all the mixed motives
of human society, and we recognize that Malthus,
with the best intentions, had treated the matter too
abstractly. Godwin had over-rated the power of
reason, Malthus the power of passion. “It is probable,”
he wrote at a later time, “that, having found
the bow bent too much one way, I was induced to
bend it too much the other, in order to make it
straight.”<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a> The abstract principle of increase getting
more, and concrete humanity less, than justice, the
next step was, naturally, to deny the possibility of
permanent improvement in this world, and to regard
every partial improvement as a labour of Sisyphus.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c016'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It could hardly be otherwise, if we began, like
Malthus, by setting down the desire of food and the
desire of marriage as two co-ordinate principles.<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c016'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
They are not really co-ordinate. It is true not merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of most men, but of all men without a single exception,
that they cannot live without food. Even if a man
survive an abstinence from solid food for forty days,
he cannot deny himself water, and he is for all useful
purposes dead to the world during his fast. The
second postulate of the first essay is, on the contrary,
true only of most men, and even then under qualifications.
It is not true of any till manhood, and it
is not true of all men equally. Some are beyond its
scope by an accident of birth, and a still larger
number, whether priests or laymen, put themselves
beyond its scope for moral reasons.<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c016'><sup>[91]</sup></a> Coleridge puts
the case pertinently enough: “The whole case is this:
Are they both alike passions of physical necessity,
and the one equally with the other independent
of the reason and the will? Shame upon our race
that there lives the individual who dares even ask
the question.”<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c016'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus saw that he had been hasty, and he did
not republish the essay till he had given it five
years of revision, and added to it the results of foreign
travel and wider reading. In 1799 he went abroad
with some college friends, Otter, Clarke the antiquarian
and naturalist, and Clarke’s pupil Cripps,<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c016'><sup>[93]</sup></a> and visited
Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and part of
Russia, these being the only countries at that time
open to English travellers. After his return he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>published his tract on the <cite>High Price of Provisions</cite>
(1800),<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c016'><sup>[94]</sup></a> and at the conclusion of it he promised
a new edition of the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>. Some
people, he says, have thought the essay “a specious
argument inapplicable to the present state of society,”
because it contradicts preconceived opinions; but
two years of reflection have strengthened his conviction
that he has discovered “the real cause of
the continued depression and poverty of the lower
classes;” and he will not recant his essay: “I have
deferred giving another edition of it in the hope of
being able to make it more worthy of the public
attention, by applying the principle directly and
exclusively to the existing state of society, and
endeavouring to illustrate the power and universality
of its operation from the best authenticated accounts
that we have of the state of other countries.” But
he was not satisfied with the accounts of other people.
When the Peace of Amiens let loose thousands of
pleasure-seekers on the Continent, Malthus went to
France and Switzerland on no errand of mere pleasure;
and he was luckily at home again, and passing
his proof-sheets through the press, before Napoleon’s
unpleasant interference with English travellers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a happy coincidence that in the dark
fighting days of 1798, Malthus should write only of
vice and misery, while in the short gleam of peace
in 1802 and 1803, when the tramp of armed men
had ceased for the moment, he should recollect
himself, and write of a less ghastly restraint on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>population, a restraint which might perhaps, like
the truce of Amiens, hold out some faint hope for
the future. For the sake of the world let us hope
that the parallel goes no further. The wonder is not
that he forgot there was such a thing as civilization,
but that amidst wars and rumours of wars he should
ever have remembered it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the preface to the new edition (June 1803),
he says he has “so far differed in principle” from
the old edition “as to suppose the action of another
check to population which does not come under the
head either of vice or misery,” and he has “tried
to soften some of the harshest conclusions of the
first essay.” There was really more change than
this. The first essay contained much of the imperfection
of the sudden magazine-article; and if the
writer had lived half a century later he would
probably, instead of writing a small book, have contributed
a long article to a monthly or quarterly
magazine, giving a review of Godwin’s political
writings, with incidental remarks on the Poor Bill
of Mr. Pitt. This was evidently the light in which
he himself regarded his first work, or he would not
have handled it so freely in republication. The new
edition had new facts, new arrangement, and new
emphasis. He had not written a book once for all,
leaving the world to fight over it after his death.
He took the public into partnership with him, and
made every discussion a means of improving his
book. This gives the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> a unique
character among economical writings. It leads the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>author to interpret his thoughts to us from many
various points of view, leaving us, unhappily, often
in doubt whether an alteration of language is or is
not an alteration of thought. Malthus adds to the
difficulty by omitting and inserting instead of rewriting
in full. His chapters cease to be old without
becoming new.</p>

<p class='c007'>The very face of the book revealed a change. In
1798 it was <cite>An Essay on the Principle of Population
as it affects the Future Improvement of Society</cite>; in
1803, <cite>An Essay on the Principle of Population, or
a View of its Past and Present Effects on Human
Happiness</cite>. The dreams of the future are now in
the background, and the facts of the present in the
foreground. In 1798 Malthus had given Godwin
the lie:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Colouring he, dilating, magniloquent, glorying in picture,</div>
      <div class='line'>He to a matter of fact still softening, paring, abating,</div>
      <div class='line'>He to the great might-have-been upsoaring, sublime and ideal,</div>
      <div class='line'>He to the merest it—was restricting, diminishing, dwarfing.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>He must do more now, or his political economy is
a dismal science. He must show how we can cling
to the matter of fact without losing our ideal. It is
not enough to refer us to the other world. How far
may we have hope in this world? Let Malthus
answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second essay is his answer; and if second
thoughts are the best, then we may rejoice over the
second essay, for it lifts the cloud from the first. It
tells us that on the whole the power of civilization is
greater than the power of population; the pressure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the people on the food is therefore less in modern than
it was in ancient times or the middle ages; there
are now less disorder, more knowledge, and more
temperance.<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c016'><sup>[95]</sup></a> The merely physical checks are falling
into a subordinate position. There are two kinds
of checks on population. A check is (<em>a</em>) positive,
when it cuts down an existing population, (<em>b</em>) preventive,
when it keeps a new population from growing
up. Among animals the check is only misery,
among savage men vice as well as misery, and, in
civilized society, moral restraint as well as, till now,
both vice and misery. Even in civilized society there
are strata which moral restraint hardly reaches, for
there are strata which are not civilized. On the
whole, however, it is true that among animals there
is no sign of any other check than the positive, while
among men the positive is gradually subordinated to
the preventive. Among men misery may act both
positively and preventively. In the form of war or
disease it may slay its tens of thousands, and cut
down an existing population. By the fear of its own
coming it may prevent many a marriage, and keep a
new population from growing up. Vice may also act
in both ways: positively as in child-murder, preventively
as in the scheme of Condorcet. But in civilized
society the forces of both order and progress are
arrayed against their two common enemies; and, if
we recognized no third check, surely the argument
that was used against Godwin’s society holds against
all society; its very purification will ruin it, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>forbidding vice and misery to check the growth of
population, and by thereby permitting the people to
increase to excess. There is, however, a third check,
which Malthus knows under the title of moral restraint.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moral restraint is a distinct form of preventive
check. It is not to be confused with an impure
celibacy, which falls under the head of vice; and yet
the adjective “moral” does not imply that the
motives are the highest possible.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c016'><sup>[96]</sup></a> The adjective is
applied not so much to the motive of the action as to
the action itself, from whatever motives proceeding;
and in the mouth of a Utilitarian this language is
not unphilosophical. Moral restraint, in the pages
of Malthus, means simply continence; it is an abstinence
from marriage followed by no irregularities.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c016'><sup>[97]</sup></a>
He speaks of the “moral stimulus” of the bounty on
corn, meaning the expectations it produced in the
minds of men, as distinguished from the variations it
produced in the prices of grain;<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c016'><sup>[98]</sup></a> and the word
“moral” is often, like “morale,” used in military
matters to denote mental disposition, as distinguished
from material resources. The vagueness of the word
is perhaps not accidental, for nothing is vaguer
than the mixed motives which it denotes; but
continence, which is unambiguous, would seem the
better word.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>With the enunciation of the third check the theory
of Malthus entered definitively on a new phase; and
in sketching the outlines of his work we shall no
longer need to treat it as paradoxical and overstrained,
but as a sober argument from the ground of accepted
facts. The author’s analysis of human nature has
been brought into harmony with common sense. He
confesses that it had hitherto been too abstract, and
had separated the inseparable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mind of man cannot be sawed into quantities;
and, even if it is possible to distinguish the
mixed motives that guide human action, the fact
remains that they only operate when together. It
is probable that no good man’s motives were ever
absolutely noble, and no bad man’s ever absolutely
bestial. Even the good man is strongest when he
can make his very circumstances war against his
power to do evil. Mixed from the first of time,
human motives will, in this world, remain mixed unto
the last, whether in saint, sage, or savage. But
civilization, involving, as it does, a progressive change
in the dominant ideas of society, will alter the character
of the mixture and the proportion of the
elements. The laws of Malthus will be obeyed,
though the name of Malthus be not mentioned, and
the checks, physical or moral, be never brought to
mind. Society, moving all together, if it move at all,
cannot cure its evils by one single heroic remedy;
but as little can it be content with self-denying ordinances,
prohibitions, or refutations. It needs a positive
truth, and an ideal, that is to say, a religion, to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>new life to the bodily members by giving new hope
to the heart. “The fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom, but the end of wisdom is the love of the
Lord and the admiration of moral good.”<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c016'><sup>[99]</sup></a> It follows
that an economist, if he knows nothing but his
economy, does not know even that.</p>

<p class='c007'>No economists are more reproached with their
want of idealism than Malthus and his brethren.
As the French Revolutionists were said to believe
that the death of their old rulers would of itself bring
happiness and good government, so these writers were
said to teach that the mere removal of hindrances
would lead to the best possible production and distribution
of the good things of this life. The ideal
state then, as far as wealth was concerned, would be
anarchy <em>plus</em> the police constable. Godwin would
have dispensed with the constable. “Give a state
liberty enough,” he says, “and vice cannot exist in
it.”<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c016'><sup>[100]</sup></a> But neither he nor the economists desired a
merely negative change or removal of hindrances.
Their political reformation was to be, like the Protestant,
only successful as it went beyond image-breaking.
Malthus, it will be seen,<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c016'><sup>[101]</sup></a> is far from
being an unqualified advocate of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</span></i>; and,
in all cases where he did desire it, he wished to
make the state small only to make public opinion
great. Godwin was not far away from him here.
If he was wrong in attributing too much evil to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>institutions, and too little to human nature, he has
furnished his own correction. The <cite>Political Justice</cite>
disclaimed all sympathy with violence; it taught
that a political reform was worthless unless effected
peacefully by reason; and Malthus<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c016'><sup>[102]</sup></a> has the same
cure for social evils—argument and instruction. The
difference between them is, that Malthus takes more
into account the unreasonableness as well as the
reasonableness of men. In essentials they are agreed.
The thorough enlightenment of the people, which
includes their moral purification as well as their
intellectual instruction, is to complete the work of
mending all, in which men are to be fellow-workers
with God—so runs the teaching of Malthus and all
the greatest economists of the last hundred years.
Whether the evils of competition are many or few,
serious or trifling, depends largely on the character
of the competitors; and the more free we make the
competition, the more thoroughly we must educate the
competitors. Adam Smith was well aware of this;
he recommended school-boards a hundred years before
the Acts of 1870 and 1872;<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c016'><sup>[103]</sup></a> and Malthus was not
behind him.<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c016'><sup>[104]</sup></a> They are aware that the more completely
we exclude the interference of Government,
the more actively we must employ every other moral
and social agency. Whether Malthus was prepared
to exclude the interference of Government entirely,
even under this condition, we shall see by-and-by.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>The characters of the two men, Malthus and Godwin,
are a striking contrast. Malthus was the student,
of quiet settled life, sharing his little wealth with his
friends in unobtrusive hospitality, and constantly
using his pen for the good, as he believed, of the
English poor, that in these wretched times they might
have domestic happiness like his own. There never
was a more singular delusion than the common
belief in the hard-heartedness of Malthus. Besides
the unanimous voice of private friends, he has left
testimony enough in his own books to absolve him.
While Adam Smith and others owe their errors to
intellectual fallibility, Malthus owes many of his to
his tender heart. His motive for studying political
economy was no doubt a mixed motive; it was partly
the interest of an intelligent man in abstract questions;
but it was chiefly the desire to advance the
greatest happiness of the greatest number. In his
eyes the elevation of human life was much more
important than the solution of a scientific problem.
Even when in 1820 he wrote a book on the “<cite>Principles
of Political Economy</cite>,” he took care to add on the
title-page, “<em>considered with a view to their practical
application</em>,” refusing to consider in abstractness what
always exists in the concrete. His keen sympathy
for the sufferings of displaced workmen led him to
fight a losing battle with Say and Ricardo in favour
of something like an embargo on inventions, and in
protest against a fancied over-production.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c016'><sup>[105]</sup></a> His private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>life showed the power of gentleness; Miss Martineau
could hear his mild, sonorous vowels without her eartrumpet,
and his few sentences were as welcome at
her dinner-table as the endless babble of cleverer
tongues. He felt the pain of a thousand slanders
“only just at first,” and never let them trouble his
dreams after the first fortnight, saying, with a higher
than stoical calmness, that they passed by him like
the idle wind which he respected not.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a> He outlived
obloquy, and saw the fruit of his labours in a wiser
legislation and improved public feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>With Godwin all was otherwise. There were fightings
within and fears without. With an immovable
devotion to ideas he combined a fickleness of affection
towards human beings. He heeded emotion too little
in his books and too much in his own life, yielding
to the fancy of the moment, quarrelling with his best
friends twice a week, and quickly knitting up the
broken ties again. He loved his wife well, but hardly
allowed her to share the same house with him, lest
they should weary of one another.<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c016'><sup>[107]</sup></a> He was the
sworn enemy of superstition, and himself the arch-dreamer
of dreams.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet when we contrast the haphazard literary life
of the one, ending his days ingloriously<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c016'><sup>[108]</sup></a> in a Government
sinecure, unsuccessful and almost forgotten,
with the academical ease of the other, centred in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the sphere of common duties, and passing from the
world with a fair consciousness of success, we feel
a sympathy for Godwin that is of a better sort than
the mere liking for a loser. It is a sympathy not sad
enough for pity. It is not wholly sad to find Godwin
in his old age a lonely man, his friends dropping off
one by one into the darkness and leaving him solitary
in a world that does not know him. The world that
had begun to realize the ideas of Malthus had begun
to realize the ideas of Godwin also. It was a world
far more in harmony with political justice than that
into which Godwin had sent his book forty years
before. It was good that Malthus had lived to see
the new Poor Law, but still better that both had lived
to see the Reform of ’32.</p>

<p class='c007'>They passed away within two years of each other,
Malthus in the winter of 1834, Godwin in the spring
of 1836, the year of the first league of the people
against the Corn Laws. In their death they were
still divided, but, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">si quis piorum manibus locus</span>,”
they are divided no longer, and they think no hard
thoughts of each other any more.</p>

<p class='c006'>The second essay applies the theory of the first to new
facts and with a new purpose. The author, having
gained his case against Godwin, ceases to be the critic
and becomes the social reformer. Despairing to
master all the forms of evil, he confines his study to
one of them in particular, the tendency of living
beings to increase beyond their means of nourishment.
This phenomenon is important both from its cause
and from its effects. Its cause is not the action of
Governments, but the constitution of man; and its
effects are not of to-day or yesterday, but constant
and perpetual;<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c016'><sup>[109]</sup></a> it frequently hinders the moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>goodness and general happiness of a nation as well as
the equal distribution of its wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the general position, which the several
chapters of the essay are to expound in detail. It
is not by itself quite simple. “The constant tendency
in all animated life [<em>sic</em>]<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c016'><sup>[110]</sup></a> to increase beyond the
nourishment prepared for it” is in one sense common
to humanity with plants and animals, but in another
sense is not common to any two of the three. It is
certainly true of all of them that the seeds of their
life, whencesoever at first derived, are now infinitely
numerous on our planet, while the means of rearing
them are strictly limited. In the case of plants and
animals the strong instinct of reproduction is “interrupted
by no reasoning or doubts about providing for
offspring,”<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a> and they crowd fresh lives into the world
only to have them at once shorn away by starvation.
With the exception of certain plants which ape their
superiors, like the drosera, and certain men who ape
their inferiors, like the cannibals, the lines of difference
between the three classes of living things are
tolerably distinct. The first class, in the struggle
for room and food, can only forestall each other and
leave each other to die; the second deliberately prey
on the first and on each other; while the third prey
on both the rest. But with man this “tendency to
increase beyond the food” differs from the same
instinct in the other two cases by more than the fact
that man has larger resources and is longer in reaching
his limit. The instinct is equally strong in him, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>he does not unquestioningly follow it. “Reason
interrupts his career,” and asks him whether he may
not be bringing into the world beings for whom he
cannot provide the means of support.<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c016'><sup>[112]</sup></a> If he brushes
reason aside, then he shares the fate of plants and
animals; he tends to multiply his numbers beyond
the room and food accessible to them, and the result
is that his numbers are cut down to these limits by
suffering and starvation. There is nothing in this
either more or less contrary to the notion of a
benevolent Providence than in the general power
given to man of acting rationally or irrationally
according to his own choice in any other instance.
On the other hand, if he listens to reason, he can no
doubt defeat the tendency, but too often he does it at
the expense of moral purity. The dilemma makes
the desire for marriage almost an “origin of evil.”
If man obeys his instincts he falls into misery, and,
if he resists them, into vice. Though the dilemma
is not perfect, its plausibility demands that we should
test it by details, and to this test Malthus may be
said to have given his whole life. His other economical
works are subordinate to the essay, and may be
said to grow out of it. Though we cannot omit them
if we would fully understand and illustrate the central
work, still the latter must come first; and its matured
form requires more than the brief summary which
has been given in the two preceding chapters.</p>

<p class='c007'>The body of the book consists of historical details,
and particular examples showing the checks to population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>in uncivilized and in civilized places, in present
and in past times. The writer means to bring his
conclusions home to his readers by the “longer way”
of induction. As this, however, was not the way in
which he himself reached them, or even stated them
at first, he will ask us first of all to look at the terms
of the dilemma in the light of his two original
postulates<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c016'><sup>[113]</sup></a>—(<em>a</em>) food is necessary, (<em>b</em>) the desire of
marriage is permanent. What is the quickest possible
increase of numbers in obedience to the second, and
of food in obedience to the first? In the most crucial
of the known instances, the actual rapidity of the
increase of population seems to be in direct proportion
to the easy possession of food; and we can infer that
the ideally rapid increase would take place where all
obstacles (whether material or moral) to the getting
of food and rearing of a family were removed, so
that nature never needed to remonstrate with instinct.
“In no state that we have yet known has
the power of population been left to exert itself with
perfect freedom.”<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a> We can guess what it would be
from the animal and vegetable world, where reason
does not as a matter of fact interfere with instinct in
any circumstances, so far as we can judge. Benjamin
Franklin, in a passage quoted by Malthus in this
connection,<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c016'><sup>[115]</sup></a> supposes that if the earth were bared of
other plants it might be replenished in a few years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>with fennel alone. Even as things are now, fennel
would fill the whole earth if the other plants
would only allow it; and the same is true of each of
the others. Townsend’s goats and greyhounds on
Juan Fernandez are a better instance, because not
hypothetical.<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c016'><sup>[116]</sup></a> Juan Fernando, the first discoverer, had
covered the island with goats from one pair.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c016'><sup>[117]</sup></a> The
Spaniards resolved to clear it of goats, in order to make
it useless to the English for provisioning. They put
on shore a couple of greyhounds, whose offspring soon
caused the goats to disappear. But without some
few goats to eat all the dogs must have died; and the
few were saved to them by their inaccessible refuges
in the rocks, from which they descended at risk of
their lives. In this way only the strongest and
fleetest dogs and the hardiest and fleetest goats
survived; and a balance was kept up between goat
food and hound population. Townsend thereupon
remarks that human populations are kept down by
want of food precisely in the same way.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is nothing to prevent the increase of human
numbers if we suppose reason to have no need (as
in the lower creatures it has no opportunity) to interfere.
To understand the situation, however, it is
best not to assume the truth of this parallelism, but
to take the actually recorded instances of human
increase under the nearest known approaches to absolute
plenty combined with moral goodness, that is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>say, with a state of society in which vice is at a
minimum. “In the northern states of America, where
the means of subsistence have been more ample, the
manners of the people more pure, and the checks to
early marriages fewer than in any of the modern states
of Europe, the population was found to double itself
for some successive periods every twenty-five years.”<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c016'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
From this near approach to an unchecked increase,
we infer that the unchecked would mean a doubling
in less than twenty-five years (say twenty, or perhaps
fifteen), and that all population, in proportion as it
is unchecked, tends towards that rate of increase.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it is difficult to find an unchecked increase of
population, it is still harder to find an unchecked
increase of food; for what is meant is not that a
people should find their food in one fertile country
with as much ease as in another, but that, for a new
people, new supplies should always be found with the
same ease as the old ones. Now it is not necessary
to suppose that the most fertile land is always used
first;<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c016'><sup>[119]</sup></a> very often it might only be used late after
the rest, through political insecurity, imperfect agriculture,
incomplete explorations, or the want of
capital; but, when it is once occupied, the question
is, will it supply new food to new-comers without
any limit at all? This would be an ideally fertile
land corresponding to the ideally expanding population.
And on some such inexhaustible increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of food an unchecked increase of population would
depend, unless men became able to live without
food altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus afterwards pointed out, in the course of
controversy,<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c016'><sup>[120]</sup></a> that there is strictly speaking no
question here of the comparison of two tendencies,
for we cannot speak of a tendency to increase food
in the same sense as a tendency to increase population.
Population is increased by itself; food is increased
not by food itself, but by an agency external
to it, the human beings that want it; and, while the
former increase is due to an instinct, the latter is (in
a sense) acquired. Eating is instinctive, but not the
getting of the food. We have, therefore, to compare an
increase due to an instinctive desire with an increase
due to labour, and “a slight comparison will show
the immensity of the first power over the second.”
Malthus allows that it is difficult to determine this
relation with exactness;<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c016'><sup>[121]</sup></a>  but, with the natural liking
of a Cambridge man for a mathematical simile,<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c016'><sup>[122]</sup></a> he
says that the one is to the other as an arithmetical
to a geometrical ratio,—that is to say, in any given
time (say a century) the one will have increased by
multiplication, the other only by addition. If we
represent both the population and the food at the
beginning of that century by ten, then the population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>will double itself in twenty-five years; the ten will
become twenty in the first twenty-five years, forty in
the second, eighty in the third, one hundred and sixty
in the last, while the food will only become twenty
in the first, thirty in the second, forty in the third,
fifty in the fourth. If this is true, it shows the
tendency of population to outrun subsistence. But
of course it needs to be shown from experience that,
while the strength of the desire remains the same in
the later stages of the growth of population as in the
earlier, the laboriousness of the labour is greater in
the later stages of the increase of food than in the
earlier. It is the plain truth, says Malthus, that
nature is niggardly in her gifts to man, and by no
means keeps pace with his desires. If men would
satisfy their desire of food at the old rate of speed,
they must exert their mind or their body much more
than at first.<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c016'><sup>[123]</sup></a> An obvious objection presents itself.
Since man’s food consists after all of the lower forms of
life, animal and vegetable, and since these admittedly
tend to increase, unchecked by themselves, in a geometrical
ratio, it might be thought that the increase
of human population and the increase of its food
could proceed together, with equal ease. But the
answer is that this unchecked geometrical increase of
the first could go on only so long as there was room
for it. It could only be true, for example, of wheat
in the corn-field at the time when the seed of it was
sown, and the field was all before it. The equality
of the two ratios would only be true of the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>crop.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a> At first there might be five or sixfold the
seed; but in after years, though the geometrical
increase from the seed would tend to be the same,
there could be no geometrical increase of the total
crop by unassisted nature. The earth has no tendency
to increase its surface. There is a tendency of animals
and vegetables to increase geometrically, in their
quality of living things, but not in their quality of
being food for man. The same amount of produce
might no doubt be gained on a fresh field, from the
seed yielded by the first, and at the same geometrical
rate; but this assumes that there is a fresh field,
and we should not then be at the proper stage to
contrast the two ratios. The contrast begins to show
itself as soon as the given quantity of land has grown
its crop, and its animal and human population have
used all its food. The question is then how any
increase of the said population, if they are confined
to their own supplies, is at all to be made possible;
the answer is, only by greater ingenuity and greater
labour in the getting of food; and, however possible
this may be, it can hardly be so easy as the increase
of living beings by their own act.</p>

<p class='c007'>The degree of disparity between the two will of
course depend on the degree of rapidity with which
an unchecked population is supposed to double itself.
Sir William Petty,<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c016'><sup>[125]</sup></a> with few trustworthy statistics,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>had supposed ten years; Euler, with somewhat better,
twelve and four-fifths; but Malthus prefers to go by
the safe figures of the American colonies, which he
always regarded as a crucial proof that the period was
not more than twenty-five. He admits the risk of his
own mathematical simile when he grants that it is
more easy to determine the rate of the natural increase
of population than the rate of the increase of food
which is in a much less degree natural (or spontaneous);
and he argues from what had been done in
England in his own time that the increase would
not even be in an arithmetical ratio, though agricultural
improvement (thanks to Arthur Young and the
Board of Agriculture, and the long reign of high
prices) was raising the average produce very sensibly.
If the Napoleonic times were the times of a forced
population in England, they were also the times of
a forced agricultural production. Yet we ourselves,
long after this stimulus, and after much high farming
unknown to our fathers, have reached only an
average produce of twenty-eight bushels per acre of
arable land as compared with twenty-three in 1770,<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c016'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
while the population has risen from about six millions
to thirty-five. It may be said that applies only to
wheat. But until lately wheat-growing was the chief
object of all our scientific agriculture; and this is
the result of a century’s improvements. It is far
from an arithmetical increase; and, even had the
produce been multiplied sevenfold, along with the
population, this would not overthrow the contention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of Malthus, for he is not speaking of any and every
increase of food, but of such an increase made by
the same methods and by the same kind of labour
as raised the old supplies.<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c016'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Once it is acknowledged
that to raise new food requires greater labour and
new inventions, while to bring new men into the
world requires nothing more than in all times past,
the disparity of the two is already admitted. The
fact that the two processes are both dependent on the
action of man, and both practically illimitable, does not
prevent them from being essentially unlike.<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c016'><sup>[128]</sup></a> Objectors
often suppose that the tendency of population to
outrun subsistence is contradicted by the existence of
unpeopled or thinly-peopled countries, just as if the
tendency of bodies to attract each other were contradicted
by the incompressibility of matter. The
important point to notice is that the one power is
greater than the other. The one is to the other as
the hare is to the tortoise in the fable. To make the
slow tortoise win the race, we must send the hare to
sleep.<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c016'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Carey (<cite>Social Science</cite>, vol. i. ch. iii. § 5) represents
the view of Malthus by the following propositions:—1.
“Matter tends to take upon itself higher forms,”
passing from inorganic to vegetable and animal life,
and from these to man. 2. Matter tends to take on
itself the vegetable and animal forms in an arithmetic
ratio only. 3. It tends to take its highest form, man,
in a geometrical ratio, so that the highest outstrips
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the lowest. In short he believes that Malthus holds
the geometrical increase to be true of man alone, and
only the arithmetical to be true of animals and
vegetables. But Malthus really attributed the
tendency to geometrical increase to all life whatsoever,
and arithmetical to all food, as such.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Macvey Napier’s Supplement to the <cite>Encyclopædia
Britannica</cite> (1824) Malthus has left his mature statement
of his cardinal principles, and, at the risk of
repetition, that account may be added here. The
main difference from the essay is in arrangement of
the leading ideas; and we may learn at least what
he conceived to be their relative importance towards
the end of his life.</p>

<p class='c007'>He begins by observing (1) that <em>all living things</em>,
of whatever kind, when furnished with their proper
nourishment tend to increase in a geometrical ratio,
whether (as wheat) by multiplying sixfold in one year,
or (as sheep) by doubling their numbers in two years,
tending to fill the earth, the one in fourteen, the other
in seventy-six years. But (2) as a matter of fact they
do not so increase, and the reason is either man’s
want of will or man’s want of power to provide them
their proper soil or pasture. The actual rate of
increase is extremely slow, while the power of increase
is prodigious. (3) Physically man is as the rest;
and if we ask what is the factor of his geometrical
increase, we can only tell it, as in the case of wheat
and sheep, by experience. (4) In the case of other
living beings, where there are most room and food
there is greatest increase. These conditions are best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>fulfilled for man in the United States, where the
distribution of wealth is better than in other equally
fertile places, and the greater number share the
advantages. The American census shows for the
three decades between 1790 and 1820 a rate of
increase that would double the numbers in 22⅓,
22½, and 23⁷⁄₁₂ years respectively, after we deduct as
immigrants ten thousand on an average every year.</p>

<p class='c007'>A striking indirect confirmation of this view of
the American increase was supplied to Malthus<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c016'><sup>[130]</sup></a> by
Joshua Milne, the author of the <cite>Treatise on Annuities</cite>.
His calculations were founded on the new Swedish
table of mortality. This table had been drawn up
from the registers of the first five years of the century,
years of unusual healthiness; and might therefore be
presumed to represent the normal condition of a new
and healthy country like the United States better
than the old table drawn up from the years before
sanitary reform and vaccination. Milne took the
Swedish table as his guide, and one million of people
as his unit of measurement; he calculated in what
proportions the component individuals of the million
must belong to childhood, youth, mature life, and old
age, in order that by the principles of the Swedish
table the million might double itself by natural
increase in twenty-five years; and he arrived at a
distribution so like that given by the American
census, that he was bound to conclude the American
rate of increase to be at the least very like one that
doubles a population in twenty-five years. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Swedish law of mortality could not be exactly true
of the United States, which are healthier as a whole
than Sweden even in Sweden’s best years.<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c016'><sup>[131]</sup></a> The
United States themselves are not the very healthiest
and wealthiest and happiest country conceivable;
and their increase is therefore not the fastest conceivable.
If the observed fact of increase is the best
proof of the capacity for increase, the observed
presence of checks leads to an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fortiori</span></i> reasoning,
whereby we infer the capacity for a greater increase
than any actually observed. To sum up the whole of
this first branch of the argument,—“taking into
consideration the actual rate of increase which appears
from the best documents to have taken place over a
very large extent of country in the United States of
America, very variously circumstanced as to healthiness
and rapidity of progress,—considering further
the rate of increase which has taken place in New
Spain and also in many countries of Europe, where
the means of supporting a family, and other circumstances
favourable to increase, bear no comparison
with those of the United States,—and adverting
particularly to the actual increase of population which
has taken place in this country during the last twenty
years<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c016'><sup>[132]</sup></a> under the formidable obstacles which must
press themselves upon the attention of the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>careless observer, it must appear that the assumption
of a rate of increase such as would double the population
in twenty-five years, as representing the natural
progress of population when not checked by the
difficulty of procuring the means of subsistence or
other peculiar causes of premature mortality, must
be decidedly within the truth. It may be safely
asserted, therefore, that population when unchecked
increases in a geometrical ratio of such a nature as to
double itself every twenty-five years.”<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The problem is only half stated; it is still to be
shown what is the rate of the increase of Food. The
case does not admit the same kind of proof. We
can suppose an unchecked increase of men going
on without any change in human nature; we have
only to suppose for the future the same encouragement
to marriage and the same habits of life, together
with the same law of mortality. But with
the increase of food the causes do not remain the
same. If good land could be got in abundance, the
increase of food from it would be in a geometrical
ratio far greater than that of the men; that of wheat,
for example, would be sixfold, as we have seen. But
good lands are comparatively few; they will in the
nature of things soon be occupied; and then the
increase of the food will be a laborious process at a
rate rather resembling a decreasing than an increasing
geometrical ratio. “The yearly increment of food, at
least, would have a constant tendency to diminish;”
and the amount of the increase in each successive ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>years would probably be less and less. In practice,
the inequalities of distribution may check the increase
of food with precisely the same efficacy as an
actual arrival at the physical limits to the getting
of the food. “A man who is locked up in a room
may fairly be said to be confined by the walls of it,
though he may never touch them.”<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c016'><sup>[134]</sup></a> But the main
point is, that, inequalities or no inequalities, there is
a tendency to diminished productiveness. Under
either condition the quantity yielded this year will
not be doubled or trebled for an indefinite period with
the same ease as it was yielded this year. In a
tolerably well-peopled country such as England or
Germany the utmost might be an increase every
twenty-five years equal to the present produce. But
the continuance of this would mean that in the next
two hundred years every farm should produce eight
times what it does now, or, in five hundred years,
twenty times as much; and even this is incredible,
though it would be only an arithmetical progression.
No doubt almost all parts of the earth are now more
thinly peopled than their capacities might allow; but
the difficulty is to use the capacities. That this view of
Malthus need not imply any ignorance or any disregard
of the resources of high farming may be judged
from the fact that our highest agricultural authority,
who recognizes the power of English farming to provide
on emergency even for our entire annual wants,
admits at the same time that, “where full employment
and the means of subsistence are abundant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>population increases in geometrical progression, and
therefore in a far more rapid proportion than the
increased productiveness of the soil, which after a
certain point is stationary.”<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c016'><sup>[135]</sup></a> “It follows necessarily”
(sums up Malthus) “that the average rate of the actual
increase of population over the greatest part of the
globe, obeying the same law as the increase of food,
must be totally of a different character from the rate
at which it would increase if unchecked.” On no
single farm could the produce be so increased as to
keep pace with the geometrical increase of population;
and what is true of a single farm is true in this case
of the whole earth. Machinery and invention can do
less in agriculture than in manufacture, and they can
never do so much as to make preventive checks
unnecessary.<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c016'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This is the argument of the <cite>Encyclopædia</cite> so far as
it relates to the theses of the essay. Malthus follows
it up by a remark on the institution of property.
The alternatives to his mind are always private
property as we now have it, and common property as
desired by Godwin. He upholds the first because,
“according to all past experience and the best observation
which can be made on the motives which operate
upon the human mind,” the largest produce from the
soil is got by that system, and because (what is
socially much more important), by making a man feel
his responsibility and his dependence on his own
efforts, it tends to cause prudence in marriage as well
as industry in work. Common property has not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>been successful, historically; and the widest extension
of popular education would not make men the fitter
for it. There is indeed a sense in which common
property might tend to carry production farther than
private property; cultivation, not being for profit but
for mere living, would not, like the present, stop at the
point where production ceased to be a good investment.
But this would mean<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c016'><sup>[137]</sup></a> that the whole energies
of the society were directed to the mere getting of
food; neither the whole society nor any part of it
would have leisure, for intellectual labour or enjoyment.
Whereas private property not only secures
the leisure, but, by stopping at the point of profitableness,
it keeps an unused reserve, on which society
may fall back in case of need. Malthus therefore
would stand by private property, though he thinks
that private proprietors may damage the national
wealth by game-preserving, and injure the poorer
classes by not spending enough on what they make.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c016'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The actual increase of population (he goes on) and
the necessity of checks to it depend on the difficulty
of getting food, from whatever cause, whether the
exhaustion of the earth or the bad structure of
society; and the difficulty is not for the remote
future but for the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is chiefly the contrast between the actual and
the possible supplies that makes men incredulous
about the necessity of checks; and we may grant that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>under an ideal government, a perfect people, and
faultless social system the produce would at first be
so great that the necessity for checks on population
would be very much reduced; but, as the earth’s
productiveness does not expand with population, it
would be a very short time before the pressure of the
checks would reassert itself—this time from no fault
of man, but from the mere nature of the soil.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c016'><sup>[139]</sup></a> The
bad government of our ancestors left much produce
unused, and in consequence we have for the present
a large margin to draw on. But, “if merely since the
time of William the Conqueror all the nations of the
earth had been well governed, and if the distribution
of property and the habits both of the rich and the
poor had been the most favourable to the demand for
produce and labour, though the amount of food and
population would have been prodigiously greater than
at present, the means of diminishing the checks to
population would unquestionably be less.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But, though the laws of nature are responsible for
the necessity of checks to population,<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c016'><sup>[140]</sup></a> “a vast mass of
responsibility remains behind, on man and the institutions
of society.” To them in the first place is due
the scantiness of the present population of the earth,
there being few parts of it that would not with better
government and better morals support twice, ten
times, or even one hundred times as many inhabitants
as now. In the second place, though man cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>remove the necessity of checks, or even make them
press much more lightly in any given place,<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c016'><sup>[141]</sup></a> he is
responsible for their precise character and particular
mode of operation. A good government and good
institutions can so direct them that they shall be
least hurtful to the general virtue and happiness, vice
and misery disappearing before moral restraint, though
after all the influence of government and institutions
is indirect, and everything depends on the conduct of
the individual citizens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rest of the article contains little that is not
in the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> (5th ed., 1817) and the
treatise on <cite>Political Economy</cite> (1st ed., 1820). It
gives the historical sketches of the former, some small
part of the economical discussions (<em>e. g.</em> on wages) of
the latter, and a short answer to current objections,
together with some tables of mortality and other
figures, of more special interest to the professional
actuary than to the general reader. The article is
an authoritative summary of the author’s doctrines in
their final form. It was not his last work. From
the fact that he undertook the paper in Sept. 1821,<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c016'><sup>[142]</sup></a>
we may perhaps infer that he placed it in Macvey
Napier’s hands in the year 1822.<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a> But it was his
last attempt to restate the subject of the essay in
an independent form with anything approaching to
fulness of detail, and it shows he had made no change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>in his position. The <cite>Summary View of the Principle
of Population</cite> (1830) was avowedly an abridgment
of the article in the <cite>Encyclopædia</cite>, and is in fact
that article with a few paragraphs omitted and a
few pronouns altered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The clear statement of the two tendencies was, in
his own eyes, the least original part of his work. It
had been often perceived distinctly by other writers
that population must always be kept down to the
level of the means of subsistence. “Yet few inquiries
have been made into the various modes by which this
level is effected, and the principle has never been
sufficiently pursued to its consequences, nor those
practical inferences drawn from it which a strict
examination of its effects on society appears to
suggest.”<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c016'><sup>[144]</sup></a> What some people would count the more
interesting question remained to be considered——the
question that touches individuals and familiar circumstances
more nearly, and is not to be answered by a
generality, from which we easily in thought except
our own individual selves. Since, at any given time,
in any given place, among any given people, there is
(1) a tendency of population to outrun subsistence,
and there is (2) no such excess as a matter of fact,
in what way or ways is the tendency prevented from
carrying itself out? As was said above,<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c016'><sup>[145]</sup></a> this is
effected in two kinds of ways—(1) by the way of
a positive, (2) by the way of a preventive check, the
former cutting down an actual population to the level
of its food, the second forbidding a population to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>need to be cut down, and being, so far as it is voluntary,
peculiar to man among living creatures. Of
the positive, all those that come from the laws of
nature may be called misery pure and simple; and
all those that men bring on themselves by wars,
excesses, and avoidable troubles of all kinds are of a
mixed character, their causes being vice and their
consequences misery. Of the preventive, that restraint
from marriage which is not accompanied by any
immoral conduct on the part of the person restraining
himself or herself is called moral restraint. Any
restraint which is prudential and preventive, but
immoral, comes under the head of vice, for every
action may be so called which has “a general tendency
to produce misery,” however innocuous its immediate
effects.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c016'><sup>[146]</sup></a> We find, therefore, that the positive and the
preventive checks are all resolvable into vice, misery,
and moral restraint, or sin, pain, and self-control,
a threefold division that makes the second essay
“differ in principle” from the first.<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c016'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>We have here a twofold alongside of a threefold
division of the checks to population. The one is
made from an objective, the other from a subjective
point of view. The division of checks (1) into positive
and preventive has regard simply to the outward
facts; a population is in those two ways kept down
to the food. The division of them (2) into vice,
misery, and moral restraint has regard to the human
agent and his inward condition, the state of his
feelings and of his will. For example, the positive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>check viewed subjectively, or from the human being’s
point of view, is the feeling of pain; the will is not
directly concerned with it. The preventive, from the
same point of view, is of a less simple character. First
of all, moral restraint involves a temporary misery or
pain in the thwarting of a desire; “considered as a
restraint upon an inclination otherwise innocent and
always natural, it must be allowed to produce a certain
degree of temporary unhappiness, but evidently slight
compared with the evils which result from any of
the other checks to population,”<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c016'><sup>[148]</sup></a> and “merely<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c016'><sup>[149]</sup></a> of the
same nature as many other sacrifices of temporary
to permanent gratification which it is the business
of a moral agent continually to make.” The reverse
is true of vicious excesses and passions; in their
immediate gratification they are pleasant, but their
permanent effects are misery. From the point of
view of the will the case is clear, for the state of the
will would be described by Malthus, if he ever used
such terms, as in the one case good, and in the other
case evil, pure and simple. Of course in treating the
matter historically we may neglect the subjective
point of view, not because it is not necessary for
proper knowledge of the facts, but because it leads
to a psychological inquiry, the results of which are
independent of dates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus goes on to say that, in all cases where
there is the need for checks at all, it is the sum total
of all the preventive and positive checks that forms
the check to population in any given country at any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>given time,<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c016'><sup>[150]</sup></a> and his endeavour will be to show in
what relative proportions and in what degree they
prevail in various countries known to us. He assumes
further that the preventive and the positive checks
will “vary inversely as each other.” In countries
where the mortality is great the influence of the
preventive check will be small; and, where the preventive
check prevails much, the positive check, or in
brief the mortality, will be small.<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In society, as it was in the first years of the nineteenth
century, Malthus thinks he can trace out even
by his own observation an “oscillation,” or what it
is the fashion to call a “cycle,” in the movement of
population. History does not show it well, simply
because “the histories of mankind which we possess
are in general only of the higher classes,”<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c016'><sup>[152]</sup></a> and it is
the labouring classes to which the observation applies.
Their painful experience of the ruder checks has not
prevented a “constant effort” in the labouring population
to have larger families than they can well
support. The consequence is that their numbers are
increased; they must divide amongst eleven and a
half millions the food that was formerly divided
among eleven millions; they must have lower wages
and dearer provisions. But this state of distress
will so check population that in process of time the
numbers will be almost at a standstill, while at the
same time, since the demand for food has been greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and labour has been cheaper, the application of capital
to agriculture will have increased the available food.
The result will be the same tolerable degree of comfort
as at the beginning of the cycle, and the same relapse
from it as at the second stage. He conceives the two
stages to follow each other as naturally as sunshine
rain and rain sunshine. The existence of such a
cycle may remain concealed from the ordinary historian,
if he looks merely to the money wages of the
labourer, for it frequently happens that the labourer
gets the same sums of money for his wages during
a long series of years when the real value of the sums
has not remained the same,—the price of bread in
what we have called the second stage of the cycle
being much dearer than it was in the first, and than
it will be in the third.<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c016'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Though Malthus expressly
qualifies his statements by showing that civilization
tends to counteract these fluctuations, it certainly
seemed to be his belief in 1803 that on the whole
the working classes of Europe, and especially of
England, were powerless to escape from them. How
far this view is justified will be seen presently.</p>

<p class='c006'>The main position of the essay was so incontrovertible,
that when the critics despaired to convict
Malthus of a paradox, they charged him with a
truism. To the friendly Hallam<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c016'><sup>[154]</sup></a> the mathematical
basis of the argument appeared as certain as the
multiplication table, and the unfriendly Hazlitt “did
not see what there was to discover after reading the
tables of Noah’s descendants, and knowing that the
world is round.”<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c016'><sup>[155]</sup></a> If the essayist had done nothing
more than put half-truths together into a whole, he
would have “entrenched himself in an impregnable
fortress” and given his work a great “air of mastery.”<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c016'><sup>[156]</sup></a>
But he would have convinced the understanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>without convincing the imagination. Adam Smith
himself would have done no more than half his work,
if he had been content to prove the reasonableness of
free trade without showing, in detail, the effect of it
and its opposites. Even the most competent reader
has seldom all the relevant facts marshalled in his
memory, ready to command; and he will always be
thankful for illustrations. The <cite>Essay on Population</cite>
in its second form certainly excelled all economical
works, save one, in its pertinent examples from life
and history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Imagination in the narrower sense of the word is
to be out of court. Malthus, like Adam Smith, not
only leaves little to his reader’s fancy, but makes
little use of his own. His own had misled his readers
in the first essay, though it had certainly given that
little book much of its piquancy; and he resolves for
the sake of truth to chain it up, as Coleridge chained
up his understanding. The self-denying ordinance
is only too fully executed. The style of his essay
is truly described by himself<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c016'><sup>[157]</sup></a> as having gradually
“lost all pretensions to merit.” Edition follows
edition, each with its footnotes, supplements, rearrangements,
and corrections, till the reader feels that
this writer “would be clearer if he were not so clear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the title-page supplies a guiding thread. From
the second edition onwards to the last, “Past” and
“Present” appear in large letters, “Future” in small.
The entire work may therefore be divided according to
the three tenses, with the emphasis on the two former.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>The first book is devoted to the past, the second to
the present, and the third and fourth to the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>The First deals with the less civilized parts of the
world as it now is, and the uncivilized past times;
the Second with the different states of modern
Europe; the Third criticizes popular schemes of future
improvement; while the Fourth gives the author’s
own views of the possible progress of humanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>After explaining his principles, Malthus takes a
survey of human progress, if not from brute to savage,
at least from savage to citizen. He shows us how
the rude and simple positive checks become complicated
with the preventive; and he leads us up from
barbarism to civilization till we find ourselves in a
society where the citizens think less of check than of
chief end, and less of self-sacrifice than of self-devotion,
to some cause or person, and even the inferior
members act, at worst, from mixed motives, containing
good as well as evil. These are the two extreme ends
of his line. It would be useless to deny that he
lingers longest over the less pleasing, and gives Godwin
some excuse for questioning his logical right to believe
in the more pleasing at all.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c016'><sup>[158]</sup></a> At the same time it
would have been (even logically) impossible for him
to have attacked Godwin for taking abstract views
of human nature, and then to have persisted in an
abstraction of his own, after all his own European
travel and historical studies. His fault had lain in
defective premises, not in false reasoning; and he
remedies the fault.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Let us take his account in his own order. Beginning
with present savagery, which with some
qualifications is a picture of our own past, he sifts
out the descriptions of Cook, Vancouver, and other
travellers, to see what checks to population operate
in different grades of savage humanity. At the very
bottom of the scale comes Tierra del Fuego, by
general consent the abode of pure misery, and therefore
naturally the home of a sparse population. Next
come the natives of the Andaman Islands and of
Van Diemen’s Land. “Their whole time is spent in
search of food,” which consists of the raw products of
the soil and sea; the whole time of every individual
is devoted to this one labour, and there is neither
room nor inducement for any other industries. Vice
is hardly needed; misery in the shape of perpetual
scarcity and famine keeps down the people to the food.
Third in the scale of human beings are the New
Hollanders, the original inhabitants of North-West
Australia, among whom can be traced not only the
check of misery, but the check of vice. The women
are so cruelly treated at all times, and the children
have so harsh an upbringing, that there is no difficulty
in understanding how population does not even reach
the full limit of the scanty food. War and pestilence
make the assurance doubly sure. As savages are
entirely innocent of sanitary science, the dirt of their
persons and their houses deprives them of “the
advantage which usually attends a thinly-peopled
country,” comparative exemption from pestilence.<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c016'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Even the North American Indians, who are one step
higher than the New Hollanders, come under the
same condemnation for overcrowding, and for much
else besides. The account which Malthus gives of
them may be compared with that of De Tocqueville
half a century later. Romance has clung to them
only because they were the nearest and best known
savages of their kind, and their necessary labours
were in Europe rich men’s pleasures. But hunting
and river-fishing cannot yield much food unless pursued
over a wide area. A hunter is so far like the
beast of prey which he pursues, that he must go long
distances for his food, and must either fly from or
overcome every rival. The North American Indian
must therefore either go West after his old food, or
else he must stay where he is, to beat off the
Europeans, or to adopt their food and their habits.
“The Indians have only two ways of saving themselves,
war and civilization. They must either
destroy the Europeans or become their equals.”<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c016'><sup>[160]</sup></a> As
the civilization of a nation of hunters is almost
impossible, their extinction seems inevitable. The
question remains, How is this population cut down
to the level of its food?</p>

<p class='c007'>In Malthus’ answer to the question occur three
remarks of great general importance. First, what
limits the numbers of a people is not the possible
but the actual food.<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c016'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Second, want destroys a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>population less often directly by starvation than
indirectly through the medium of manners and
customs.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c016'><sup>[162]</sup></a> Third, the mere pressure of impending
starvation does not lead to progress.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c016'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus is never tired of insisting on the first of these
remarks; and a proper understanding of it is essential
to a fair judgment on his doctrine. He never says
that it is the tendency of a population to increase up
to the limits of the greatest possible amount of food
that can be produced in a given country. The valley
of the Mississippi when highly cultivated may possibly
support a hundred millions; but the question is not
what it would do when highly cultivated, but what
it can do when cultivated as it now is and as men
now are. “In a general view of the American
continent as described by historians, the population
seems to have been spread over the surface very
nearly in proportion to the quantity of food which
the inhabitants of the different parts in the actual
state of their industry and improvements could as a
matter of fact obtain; and that with few exceptions
it pressed hard against this limit, rather than fell short
of it, appears from the frequent recurrence of distress
for want of food in all parts of America.”<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c016'><sup>[164]</sup></a> What is
said here of the Indians a hundred years ago applies
to the Colonists now. “The actual state of industry”
is of course a much more improved one; but the
population the land will bear is still in proportion
to it, and the amount could not have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>increased till the actual state of the industry had first
been bettered. One cause of the decay of the numbers
of the Indians was that their method of industry, so
far from becoming better, became worse by their contact
with Europeans, and therefore the limit of population
was actually contracted instead of being extended.<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c016'><sup>[165]</sup></a>
This explains how it is that their diminishing numbers
do not bring them greater comfort. Whether the
numbers in any given case are too great or too small
depends always on the quantity of the food that is
divided among them; and, where the food decreases
faster than the population, a population that has
become smaller numerically becomes actually larger
in proportion to the food. The statement that
England or any other country could bear millions
more than it does now is a mere reference to unexplored
possibilities, landing us in the infinite. It
may be answered in the same way as the Eleatic
puzzles about motion; land infinitely improvable
does not mean land infinitely improved, as matter
infinitely divisible does not mean matter infinitely
divided. The position of Malthus is therefore as
follows: given a people’s skill, and given its standard
of living at any time, its numbers are always
tending to be the utmost that can be furnished by
that skill with a living up to that standard,—that is
to say, with what, according to that standard, are the
necessaries of human life. Either a diminution of
that skill or an increase in that standard would cause
over-population. The question is always a relative one.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The human as distinguished from the animal
character of the problem appears not only in that
relativity (which affects mainly the preventive checks),
but in the indirect way in which the positive checks,
if we may say so, prefer to act. It is as if they
were always desirous of resolving themselves as far
as might be into preventive. The ultimate check,
Malthus says, is starvation; but, he adds, it is seldom
the immediate one. The higher up we go in the
scale, the more it is hidden away out of sight. Starvation
is interpreted, by all grades of society above
the lowest, to mean the loss of what they conceive to
be the necessaries not of a bare living but of endurable
life; and even the lowest, instead of apprehending
some pain, apprehend some bringer of it. They do
not allow famine to kill them; they create manners
and customs that do the work for it, keeping the
famine itself afar off. “Both theory and experience
uniformly instruct us that a less abundant supply of
food operates with a gradually increasing pressure for
a very long time before its progress is stopped. It is
difficult indeed to conceive a more tremendous shock
to society than the event of its coming at once to the
limits of the means of subsistence, with all the habits
of abundance and early marriages, which accompany a
largely increasing population. But, happily for mankind,
this never is nor ever can be the case. The
event is provided for by the concurrent interests and
feelings of individuals long before it arrives; and the
gradual diminution of the real wages of the labouring
classes of society slowly and almost insensibly generates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the habits necessary for an order of things in which
the funds for the maintenance of labour are stationary....
The causes [of the retardation of population]
will be generally felt and [will] generate a change of
habits long before the period arrives.”<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c016'><sup>[166]</sup></a> “An insufficient
supply of food to any people does not show
itself merely in the shape of famine, but in other
more permanent forms of distress, and in generating
certain customs which operate sometimes with greater
force in the prevention of a rising population” than in
the destruction of the risen.<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c016'><sup>[167]</sup></a> Robertson the historian
truly says, that whether civilization has improved
the lot of men may be doubtful, but it has certainly
improved the condition of women. Among the Indians
and almost all savages, “servitude is a name too mild
to describe their wretched state.” The hard life of
the men kills their instinctive fondness for the women;
the latter are therefore less likely to become mothers,
while, if they do, their own hardships and heavy tasks
are a great hindrance to nursing. It is not surprising
that the surviving children are of good physique;
none but the exceptionally strong could weather the
cruel discipline of childhood.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c016'><sup>[168]</sup></a> In South America
the difficulty of upbringing actually led to an enforced
monogamy, as well as to late marriages and
their not unfrequent accompaniment, irregularities
before marriage. Such customs diminish numbers.
But even the adult savages do not find life easy.
They are not the men to think of providing for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>rainy day; in the short moments of plenty they do
not think of the long days of want. Intemperate
living as well as the rigour and the accidents of a
hunting life cut off numbers in their prime. They
are subject to diseases and invent no remedies. Their
acquiescence in dirt leads to pestilences, but they invent
no sanitary reforms; and their thinly-peopled
country loses its natural exemption from epidemics.
Their wars are internecine, for they are largely
prompted by sheer self-preservation, and the thought
that if the one combatant lives the other cannot.
Cannibalism itself was at first due to extreme want,
though what occasional hunger had begun, hate perpetuated
in a custom. This and the low cunning
and mean strategy, due to a resolve to survive at
all costs, are the prime inventions of the struggle for
existence on these low levels.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such are the causes by which the numbers of the
North American Indians are kept down to a very low
figure; but, low as it is, the figure is high enough for
the food. Apart from a difference in the standard of
living, the proportion of population to food is similar
over the inhabited world; and in the same neighbourhood
or among cognate races it will be almost
identical. A diminution in one Indian tribe, not
being voluntary, will not be the cause of plenty to
the survivors; it has been the effect of want, and it
will simply weaken the collective force of the tribe
in the struggle against others.<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c016'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The supremacy of want as the ultimate check on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>population is illustrated by the instant expansion of
population which is produced in these grades of
humanity by an accession of plenty. When a tribe
falls upon fertile land, its numbers swell, and its collective
might, depending on numbers, becomes greater.
The increase of food, however, seems in this case to
lead to nothing else than increase of numbers. There
is a melancholy equality of suffering between tribe and
tribe, as well as between members of the same tribe.
There is no distinction of rank, but only of sex and
bodily strength, as regards endurance of hardships.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is in this connection that Malthus throws some
light on the question how progress could ever take
place at all. His answer is not unlike Adam Smith’s
remark about the connection of high wages with good
work. He says, that beyond a certain limit, hard
fare and great want depress men below the very
capacity of improvement; comfort must reach a
certain height before the desires of civilized life can
come into being at all. If the American tribes, he
says, have remained hunters, it is not simply because
they have not increased in numbers sufficiently to
render the pastoral or agricultural state necessary to
them. Reasons which Malthus does not pretend to
particularize,<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c016'><sup>[170]</sup></a> and which he allows to be unconnected
with mere increase or decrease of numbers, have prevented
these tribes from ever trying to raise cattle
or grow corn at all. “If hunger alone could have
prompted the savage tribes of America to such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>change in their habits, I do not conceive that there
would have been a single nation of hunters and fishers
remaining; but it is evident that some fortunate
train of circumstances, in addition to this stimulus,
is necessary for this purpose; and it is undoubtedly
probable that these arts of obtaining food will be first
invented and improved in those spots which are best
suited to them, and where the natural fertility of the
situation, by allowing a greater number of people to
subsist together, would give the fairest chance to the
inventive powers of the human mind.” “A certain
degree of [political] security is perhaps still more
necessary than richness of soil to encourage the change
from the pastoral to the agricultural state.”<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c016'><sup>[171]</sup></a> These
passages are remarkable because they seem to contradict
the general tenor of the author’s writings.
We were told with great emphasis in the first edition
of the essay that difficulties generate talents,<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c016'><sup>[172]</sup></a> and
even the second and later are full of approving commentaries
on the proverb, “Necessity is the mother
of invention.”<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c016'><sup>[173]</sup></a> The contradiction is soon solved.
Malthus has no faith in the civilizing power of competition
when it means a struggle among starved
men for bare life, but much faith in it when it means
the struggle for greater comfort among those who
already have the animal necessaries.<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c016'><sup>[174]</sup></a> The significance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>of his admissions will be noticed later. Meanwhile
it must be observed that the passage just
quoted is not perfectly precise. The larger the
society, the greater might be the division of labour
and consequent stimulus to invention; but a tribe
might be large and yet have little in it of a society,
and still less of a division of labour. Without
such favouring circumstances as Malthus mentions
the progress cannot take place; but even with them
it need not; they are therefore not the real motive
power.</p>

<p class='c007'>The account of the state of population among the
South Sea Islanders,<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c016'><sup>[175]</sup></a> which comes next in order to
the chapter on the American Indians, is an illustration
of these remarks. These savages live in a fertile
country and yet they make no progress. As this
is not the only point illustrated, it is worth while
to look at the chapter in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus begins by observing that population must
not be thought more subject to checks on an island
than on a continent. The Abbé Raynal, in his book
on the Indies, had tried to explain a number of
modern customs that retarded population<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c016'><sup>[176]</sup></a> by referring
them to an insular origin. He thought that
they were caused at first by the over-population
of Britain and other islands, and were imported
therefrom into the continents, to the perplexity of
later ages. But as a matter of fact population on
the mainlands is subject to the same laws as on
the islands, though the limits are not so obvious to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>common observation, and the case is not put so neatly
in a nutshell. A nation on the continent may be as
completely surrounded by its enemies or its rivals,
savage or civilized, as any islanders by the sea; and
emigration may be as difficult in the one case as in the
other. Both continent and island are peopled up to
their actual produce. “There is probably no island
yet known, the produce of which could not be further
increased. This is all that can be said of the whole
earth. Both are peopled up to their actual produce.
And the whole earth is in this respect like an island.”<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c016'><sup>[177]</sup></a>
The earth is indeed more isolated than any island of
the sea, for no emigration from it is possible. The
question, therefore, to be asked about the whole earth
as about any part of it, is, “By what means the
inhabitants are reduced to such numbers as it can
support?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was the question which forced itself on Captain
Cook when he visited the islands of the Pacific and
Indian Oceans. Some of his experiences there, especially
in New Zealand, show that the native population
was kept down in nearly the same way as the
American. Their chief peculiarity is the extreme
violence of their local feuds. The people of every
village he visited petitioned him to destroy the
people of the next, and “if I had listened to them
I should have extirpated the whole race.” A sense
of human kinship is impossible at so low a level
of being; and the internecine wars of the New
Zealanders were the chief check to their numbers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>which, from the distressing effects of occasional
scarcities, would seem always at the best to have
been close to the limits of the food.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first impression of common sense is that distress
is natural where food is scanty, and unnatural
where it is plentiful. But “if we turn our eyes from
the thinly-scattered inhabitants of New Zealand to the
crowded shores of Otaheite and the Society Islands”
we find no such phenomenon. “All apprehension
of death seems at first sight to be banished from a
country that is described to be fruitful as the garden
of the Hesperides.” But reflection tells us that
happiness and plenty are the most powerful causes
of increase. We might, therefore, expect a large
population in Otaheite; at its first start it might
double itself not in twenty-five but in fifteen years.
Captain Cook estimated it (on his second voyage in
1773) as 204,000. How could a country about one
hundred and twenty miles in circuit support an
increase that doubled these numbers in twenty-five
years? Emigration is impossible, for the other
islands are in the same situation. Further cultivation
is inadequate, for scientific invention is quite
wanting. The answer is that the increase does not
take place, and yet there is no miracle. Licentiousness
among the higher classes, and infanticide
amongst all classes, are freely practised. The free
permission of infanticide no doubt, as Hume remarks,<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c016'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
tends as a rule rather to increase than to diminish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>population, for “by removing the terrors of too
numerous a family it would engage many people in
marriage,” and such is the force of natural affection,
that comparatively few parents would carry out their
first intentions. But in Otaheite in its old state
custom had made infanticide easy, and it was a real
check. War against other islands was a third check,
frequently destroying the food as well as the people,
thus striking down two generations at once. All
these checks notwithstanding, the population was up
to the level of the food, and there was as much
scarcity and keen distress as on any barren island.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such at least was the state of things discovered by
Captain Cook in his three voyages (the last in 1778)
and Captain Vancouver (in 1791). On the other hand,
the author of <cite>A Missionary Voyage to the South Pacific
Ocean in 1796–8</cite> (London, 1799) found a people very
scanty as compared with the food. The accuracy of
both accounts is borne out by the description of the
habits of the people at these two periods. Captain
Cook says they were careful to save up every scrap of
food, and yet suffered often from famine. The missionaries
observe the frequency of famine in the Friendly
Islands and the Marquesas, but say of the Otaheitans
that they are extremely wasteful, and yet never seem
to be in want. Even in the intervals between one
of Cook’s voyages and another the state of the island
had altered. Malthus sees here an illustration of two
facts. The one is that, apart from changes in the
standard of living, population fluctuates between
great excess and great defect, great numbers with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>great mortality, and great comfort with rapid multiplication
of numbers. The other, which explains the
first, is that any cause affecting population, either
towards increase or towards decrease, continues to
act for some time after the disappearance of the
circumstances that first occasioned it. For example,
over-populousness would lead to wars,<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c016'><sup>[179]</sup></a> and the
enmities of these wars would long survive their first
occasion. Again, over-populousness would lead to
greater infanticide and vice, which would become
habitual. New circumstances would, no doubt, after
a time bring new habits, and, to use the author’s
words, would “restore the population, which could not
long be kept below its natural level without the most
extreme violence. How far European contact may
operate in Otaheite with this extreme violence and
prevent it from recovering its former population is a
point which experience only can determine. But,
should this be the case, I have no doubt that on
tracing the causes of it, we should find them to be
aggravated vice and misery.”<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c016'><sup>[180]</sup></a> As a matter of fact
either European contact has caused a diminution, or
exacter inquiry has made a lower estimate of the
population of all Polynesia. The people of the whole
Society Islands is reckoned at between 15,000 and
18,000,<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c016'><sup>[181]</sup></a> which is a long way from Cook’s estimate
of 204,000 for Otaheite alone. We can hardly
believe, however, that the vice and misery of Otaheite
are more than ten times as great as they were in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>1773; and perhaps we may suppose Malthus to mean
that, if the European influences were of the same
character at the end as they were at the beginning,
and were as pernicious to the Polynesian as to the
Red Indian, the language of pessimism would be
justified. The passage at least shows how unfair it
is to suppose Malthus to desire at all costs a small
population; he is careful to say that, while vice in
Otaheite by reducing the numbers caused a transient
plenty among the survivors, still “a cause which may
prevent any particular evil may be beyond comparison
worse than the evil itself.”<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c016'><sup>[182]</sup></a> Life itself may be
bought too dear.</p>

<p class='c007'>No good is done, however, by denying that excessive
numbers are an evil, or by optimistic assertion
that if men are only good they will be happy.
There is at least one Polynesian island whose past
history gives a picturesque proof of the contrary.
Pitcairn, “the lonely isle of the Mutineers,” was a
moral contrast to Otaheite. The inhabitants owed
nothing good to their parents, who were the mutineers
of H.M.S. ‘Bounty,’ and the women of Otaheite
that came with them in 1790, when they first took
refuge in Pitcairn Island. They owed all to the
religious teaching of John Adams, which made them
so good, that there were few like them on the
earth.<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c016'><sup>[183]</sup></a> But in latitudes just touching the tropics,
with a single square mile of poor soil, surrounded
by wide ocean, they had no outlet for trade and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>modern arts. Like the inhabitants of Godwin’s
Utopia,<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c016'><sup>[184]</sup></a> they soon peopled the little country to the
full extent of the food that could be got by the old
methods, and, unlike the Utopians, they had not
skill to invent new. If they had not drawn the
line for themselves, misery would have done it for
them. Their little colony at its first founding consisted
of fifteen men and twelve women. Fourteen
men and many women died off in the course of the
ten years which passed before the time of moral
regeneration. But they left many children; and,
when the patriarch John Adams was visited by a
passing ship in 1814, he was surrounded by a happy
circle of devout families. Rapidly outgrowing the
resources of the place, these simple folk removed in
1831 to Tahiti, eighty-seven strong. Some remained
there; others had no pleasure in their new abode,
and came back to suffer affliction with the people
of God, believing with Malthus that “a cause which
may prevent any particular evil may be beyond all
comparison worse than the evil itself.” The evil was
real, however, and, in default of celibacy or new ways
of bread winning, their only cure seemed emigration.
So in 1855, Tahiti seeming ineligible, they journeyed
further west to Norfolk Island. Though there are
more than four hundred and forty to the square
mile in England and Wales, two hundred people of
this primitive sort had been certainly too many for
the single square mile of Pitcairn Island; and they
did not leave a moment too soon. Home sickness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>brought back two entire families (of seventeen
persons) in 1859. One or two stray travellers joined
them five years afterwards; but, with allowance for
these, we find that the increase of population on Pitcairn
Island reaches the highest estimate of Malthus.
When the English Admiral D’Horsey visited the
place in 1878, the quarter of a hundred had grown in
nineteen years, at the moderate cost of twelve deaths,
to a population of ninety<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c016'><sup>[185]</sup></a> persons. The primeval
virtues will avail little without the modern arts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to Malthus, we find him following an
order of his own, in rough conformity with the
orthodox progress from deer to sheep, and from
sheep to corn. He takes us from Polynesian savages
to the nomad pastoral nations of ancient Europe.<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c016'><sup>[186]</sup></a>
The vast migrations and their momentous historical
effects he ascribes to the “constant tendency in the
human race to increase” beyond its food, and thinks
that when history has been rewritten it will contain
more of this.<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c016'><sup>[187]</sup></a> “The misfortune of history is, that
while the particular motives of a few princes and
leaders are sometimes detailed with accuracy, the
general causes which crowd their standards with
willing followers are totally overlooked.”<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c016'><sup>[188]</sup></a> At first
sight the phenomenon of civilized agricultural
nations unable to repel the invasion of shepherds
seems incredible; a country in pasture cannot
possibly support so many inhabitants as a country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>in tillage. A shepherd, it is true, is nearer to the
skilled labourer than a hunter; he does not simply
take what nature gives him, where nature puts it;
he keeps the desired objects of consumption under
his own control, and his life is stronger because more
social. Early African colonization, as Adam Smith
pointed out, was less successful than early American,
because the natives, being shepherds and even farmers
rather than fishermen, were stronger in their resources
and more united than the American aborigines, so
that the European intruders were not able to displace
them.<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c016'><sup>[189]</sup></a> We should have expected the Scythian,
Cimbrian, and Gothic invaders of ancient times to
have had a similar rebuff. “But what renders
nations of shepherds so formidable is the power
which they possess of moving altogether, and the
necessity they frequently feel of exerting this power
in search of fresh pasture for their herds.”<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c016'><sup>[190]</sup></a> They
have always in their breeding stock a reserve of food
for an emergency. The mere consciousness that their
mode of life does not bind them to one place gives
them less anxiety about providing for a family.
Therefore, when they exhaust one region and begin
to feel the pinch of want, they make an armed
emigration on the scale of whole tribes at once, for
the occupation of more fruitful regions, and, as a rule,
the conquest of them by force. The law of their life
is a series of periodical “struggles for existence”<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c016'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
between one nation and another, in which the fittest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>survive at the cost of a prodigious waste of human
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The milder initial stage of this process is illustrated
by the separation of Abram and Lot in the book of
Genesis.<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c016'><sup>[192]</sup></a> Abram “was very rich in cattle.” “Lot also
had flocks and herds and tents. And the land was
not able to bear them that they might dwell together,
for their substance was great, so that they could not
dwell together. And there was a strife between the
herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s
cattle.” They agreed, therefore, to separate, Lot choosing
the fertile valley of the Jordan, Abram going to
the left into the land of Canaan. Migrations of the
same sort, more or less peaceable, are described by
modern writers as extending the Russian people from
time to time farther and farther to the south and
east.<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c016'><sup>[193]</sup></a> In the instances best known to history the
migrations were far from peaceable, and the puzzle
has been to account for their recurrence. The
slaughter of the German barbarians by Marius,
Cæsar, Drusus, Tiberius, Germanicus did not prevent
the reappearance of similar hordes of invaders a
generation later. Claudius destroyed a quarter of a
million of Goths; Aurelian and Probus had the same
work to do again. Under Diocletian the barbarians,
finding the conquest of Rome too much for them,
slaughtered one another in frontier wars. No losses
seemed to exhaust the permanent possibilities of
population in those quarters. At last in the fourth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>century “clouds of barbarians seemed to collect from
all parts of the northern hemisphere. Gathering
fresh darkness and terror as they rolled on, the
congregated bodies at length obscured the sun of
Italy and sunk the Western world in night.”<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c016'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Why were the resources of the North so inexhaustible?
Simply because the power of increase is
inexhaustible. The North was not, it is true, more
densely peopled then than now. “The climate of
ancient Germany has been mollified and the soil
fertilized by the labour of ten centuries from the
time of Charlemagne. The same extent of ground
which at present maintains in ease and plenty a
million of husbandmen and artificers, was unable to
supply a hundred thousand lazy warriors with the
simple necessaries of life. The Germans abandoned
their immense forests to the exercise of hunting,
employed in pasturage the most considerable part
of their lands, bestowed on the small remainder a
rude and careless cultivation, and then accused the
scantiness and sterility of a country that refused to
maintain the multitude of its inhabitants. When
the return of famine severely admonished them of
the importance of the arts, the national distress
was sometimes alleviated by the emigration of a
third, perhaps, or a fourth part of their youth.”<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c016'><sup>[195]</sup></a> In
short, the countries were more than fully peopled
up to their actual produce; and, though by agriculture
the actual produce would have been made
greater, yet agriculture was not extended. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>passion of the Germans for wine did not lead them
to plant vineyards by the Rhine and Danube, but
to rob the vintage of Italy. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pigrum quin immo
et iners videtur sudore acquirere quod possis sanguine
parare.</span>”<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c016'><sup>[196]</sup></a> Malthus supposes that even the Mark
system of land-holding, with its absence of cities
and its periodical redistributions of land, may have
sprung from a political motive, the fear of accustoming
the people to a settled agricultural life, and the
desire to make emigration less irksome to them.<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c016'><sup>[197]</sup></a> So
long as there were weaker peoples to be plundered, the
northern nations might freely double their numbers
every twenty-five years, or oftener, and descend again
on Italy and the South. Only when the whole was
occupied by their own people who were not likely to
be less stout for defence than for conquest, were the
hordes forced back. Not perhaps till gunpowder was
invented was Europe finally safe against them. Long
after their last inland invasions, the Norsemen found
their way by sea to the shores of England and France.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gibbon’s account of the matter is, according to
Malthus, substantially true. The only flaw is that
he thinks it necessary, in denying the greater populousness
of North Europe in ancient times, to deny
the possibility of a rapid increase of population.<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c016'><sup>[198]</sup></a> The
German people were on the whole virtuous and
healthy in their manners of living, and, the checks
to increase being mainly the positive ones of war
and famine, the increase itself was prodigious. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Gibbon is greatly in advance of Montesquieu, who
believes with Sir William Temple, Mariana, and
Machiavelli, that the northern countries were, as a
matter of fact, more densely peopled then than they
are now, and that, further, when the Romans repelled
them, a huge multitude was driven far north and
remained there biding its time. The same (says
Montesquieu) happened under Charlemagne, and
would happen again if a modern prince were to
make the same ravages in Europe; “the nations
repulsed to the north, backed against the limits of
the universe, would there make a firm stand, till the
moment when they would inundate and conquer
Europe a third time.”<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c016'><sup>[199]</sup></a> We are to suppose these
immense multitudes living “at the limits of the
universe” on ice and air for some hundreds of years.
If this is to answer to the question-begging question,
why the North is less fully peopled than it once
was, it involves a miracle. But nothing more supernatural
than ordinary laws is really needed to explain
the movements of pastoral nations a thousand years
ago. They are the same that govern the Tartars and
Bedouins now.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c016'><sup>[200]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the modern nomads,<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c016'><sup>[201]</sup></a> it is true, the comparative
simplicity of the circumstances and the comparative
thoroughness of our knowledge about them,
enable us to see plainly that the local distribution
of the people is in strict accordance with the local
distribution of the food, in other words, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“the quantity of food the people can obtain in the
actual state of their industry and habits.” We
should see the same thing of the rest of the world’s
inhabitants, if the complicated commerce of civilized
nations did not make it less gross and palpable. The
power of the earth to support life may be compared
with the power of a horse to carry burdens. He is
strong in proportion to the strength of his weakest
part, as a chain to the strength of its weakest link;
and the earth’s powers of nourishment are great in
proportion to their greatness in the worst seasons of
the year.<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c016'><sup>[202]</sup></a> Again, owing to imperfect facilities for
distribution, one part of a society may suffer want
when another is in plenty.<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c016'><sup>[203]</sup></a> Among the Tartars and
the Arabs this is plainly seen; and it is clear, too,
how the waste of life from war not only acts as a
direct check on population, but checks it indirectly
by repressing productive industry. Its fruits would
have no chance of preservation. “Even the construction
of a well requires some funds or labour in
advance, and war may destroy in one day the work
of many months and the resources of a whole year.”<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c016'><sup>[204]</sup></a>
When once warlike habits have become fixed, the two
evils, war and scarcity, reproduce and perpetuate one
another. The encouragements held out to large
families by the Mohammedan religion have a like
effect. “The promise of Paradise to every man who
had ten children would but little increase their
numbers, though it might greatly increase their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>misery.”<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c016'><sup>[205]</sup></a> It could only increase their numbers if
it increased their food, and it could not increase their
food without changing their warlike habits into habits
of industry. Failing this, it simply creates a constant
uneasiness (through want and poverty) that multiplies
occasions of war. Fortunately for himself, the
Arab often proportions his religious obedience to the
extent of his resources,<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c016'><sup>[206]</sup></a> and in hard times, “when
there is a pig at hand and no Koran,” he thinks best
to eat what God has given him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing but increase of food will permanently
increase population, and where there is food the increase
will reach up to it. In those parts of Africa
that have furnished the Western slave supplies, there
has been no discernible gap from the “hundred years’
exportation of negroes which has blackened half
America.”<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c016'><sup>[207]</sup></a> Even in Egypt, where there is a striking
contrast between natural fertility and human lethargy,
the cause is not any deficiency in the principle of
increase. It is that property is insecure, the government
being despotic and its exactions indefinite. It
is not the want of population that has checked
industry, but the want of industry that has checked
population; and it is bad government that has occasioned
the want of industry. “Ignorance and despotism
seem to have no tendency to destroy the passion
which prompts to increase, but they effectually destroy
the checks to it from reason and forethought....
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Industry cannot exist without foresight and security;
the indolence of the savage is well known, and the
poor Egyptian or Abyssinian farmer without capital,
who rents land which is let out yearly to the highest
bidder, and who is constantly subject to the demands
of his tyrannical masters, to the casual plunder of an
enemy, and not unfrequently to the violation of his
miserable contract, can have no heart to be industrious,
and, if he had, could not exercise that industry
with success. Even poverty itself, which appears to
be the great spur to industry, when it has once passed
certain limits almost ceases to operate. The indigence
which is hopeless destroys all vigorous exertion, and
confines the efforts to what is sufficient for bare
existence.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c016'><sup>[208]</sup></a> It is the hope of bettering our condition,
and the fear of want rather than want itself, that is
the best stimulus to industry; and its most constant
and best directed efforts will almost invariably be
found among a class of people above the class of the
wretchedly poor.”<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c016'><sup>[209]</sup></a> This passage repeats an idea
expressed in every book of the essay.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c016'><sup>[210]</sup></a> Government
can retard the increase of population both directly
and indirectly, but can only advance it indirectly,
namely, by encouraging industry, more especially
agriculture. For example, industrious agriculture
has made China capable of bearing a great population,
though other causes of a more equivocal character
have made it exceed its great capacities, and its
excessive numbers are cut down by famine and child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>murder.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c016'><sup>[211]</sup></a> The Roman emperors found it impossible
by legislation to promote the increase of the old
Roman stock, because they found it impossible to
restore the old Roman habits of industry, though
believers in the superior populousness of ancient
nations used to mistake their intentions for accomplished
facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the eighteenth-century dispute about the populousness
of ancient nations (one particular skirmish
in the general battle of the books) we have seen that
Malthus declares for the moderns. He gives his
opinion in detached passages; but, putting together
the different parts wherever we can find them, we
discover his proof to depend on two principles, which
are corollaries of the primary doctrine of the essay.
The first is, that without the extension of agriculture
or the better distribution of its fruits there can be
no increase of population;<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c016'><sup>[212]</sup></a> the second is, that whatever
is unfavourable to industry is to that extent
unfavourable to population.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c016'><sup>[213]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Now in the early days of Greece and Rome<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c016'><sup>[214]</sup></a> the
population ought on these principles to have been
a large one, for not only was agriculture actively
prosecuted, but property and wealth were more
equally divided among the people than in later
times. On the other hand, the numbers were always
up to the level of the resources; and the smallness of
the political divisions made law-givers like Solon, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>theorists like Plato and Aristotle, conscious of the
risk of over-population and full of plans to provide
against it. It is one of Aristotle’s criticisms of Plato’s
Republic that Plato has not sufficiently met this
difficulty, or realized that a community of goods or an
equal distribution of property is impossible without a
limitation of families. If every one may have as
many children as he pleases, the result will soon be
poverty and sedition. Of the preventive checks
actually recommended by the highest wisdom of the
Greek world, the mildest is late marriages; the rest
include exposure and abortion. Colonization was
rather adopted in practice than recommended in
theory. Frequent wars and occasional plagues were
the chief positive checks.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Rome even more evidently than in Greece<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c016'><sup>[215]</sup></a> the
causes that produced inequality of property led also
to thinness of population. In our own days the
absorption of small proprietors by large would have
this effect in a less degree, because the large would
need to employ the labour of the small. In Rome
the labour was done by slaves; and the wonder was not
that the number of free citizens should decrease, but
that any should exist at all, except the proprietors.<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c016'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Yet the legislation of Augustus in favour of
marriage, and the universal lamentation of the later
Roman writers over the extinction of the old Roman
stock, are no more than a presumption that the
population was decreasing, not a proof of its actual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>smallness, while the prevalence of war and infanticide,
so often used to prove the same point, tend really
to do the opposite. They are for the time positive
encouragements to marriage, for people will not
hesitate to bring children into the world, if they are
either free to kill off the superfluous or certain to
find sad vacancies ready for them.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c016'><sup>[217]</sup></a> In the former
case, as we noticed, parental feeling will often interfere
with the infanticide, and save rather too many
than too few.<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c016'><sup>[218]</sup></a> Wars, on the other hand, may injure
the quality of the population by removing the most
stalwart and even the most intelligent men; but there
is as much food as before, there is more room, and
there are therefore more marriages, till all the gaps
are filled, even to overflowing.<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c016'><sup>[219]</sup></a> Livy need not have
wondered that in the Volscian wars the more were
killed the more seemed to come on. The like is true
of plague and famine; epidemics, like the small-pox,
have never permanently lessened the population,
though they have increased the mortality of the infected
countries.<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c016'><sup>[220]</sup></a> To take only one instance (from
Süssmilch)—a third of the people in Prussia and
Lithuania were destroyed by the plague in 1710,
and in 1711 the number of marriages was very nearly
double the average.<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c016'><sup>[221]</sup></a> Emigration in like manner may
drain off the best blood of a nation, but cannot reduce
its numbers for any length of time, unless the nation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>is learning a new standard of comfort. Greece and
Rome were not less populous because they were great
colonizers.<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c016'><sup>[222]</sup></a> The known existence of a number of very
active checks to population, instead of proving that
the population was absolutely small, might more
naturally, other things being equal, prove it to have
been absolutely large. It might be argued that, if
the population had not been great, fewer and less
potent checks would have done the work.<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c016'><sup>[223]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But other things were not equal. We know that
the gratuitous distribution of foreign corn had ruined
Roman husbandry.<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c016'><sup>[224]</sup></a> We know that even the labour
of the slaves who had supplanted the free labourers
of Italy had not been sufficiently (or sufficiently
well) directed to agriculture. Moreover, the increase
by marriage in the number of slaves did not even
balance the decrease in the number of the free men;
else why should the Romans need to import fresh cargoes
of slaves every year from all parts of the world?<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c016'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In short, the Roman habits had become “unfavourable
to industry, and therefore to population.” The
very necessity for such a law as the Papia Poppæa
would indicate a moral depravity inconsistent with
habits of industry. This strong argument had
escaped even Hume, who thought that the people
would increase very fast under the Peace of Trajan
and the Antonines, forgetting that the people could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>not unlearn their habits in so short a time; unlearning
is harder than learning, especially for a whole
people; and, “if wars do not depopulate much when
industry is in vigour, peace does not increase population
much when industry is languishing.”<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c016'><sup>[226]</sup></a> Contrariwise,
it might be argued that the prevention of
child-murder in India will not cause over-population,
when it is part of a general policy accustoming the
people to European habits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Allow, then, that general viciousness is inconsistent
with general industry, and it follows that those
ancient nations in which the first prevailed were less
populous than the modern. This seems to be the
argument of Malthus brought to a focus. From the
absence of censuses,<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c016'><sup>[227]</sup></a> it is strictly deductive; there
<em>could</em> not have been so many people as now, and
therefore there <em>were</em> not.<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c016'><sup>[228]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Expressed in more technical language, the meaning
is, that where there is nothing present but the positive
check and the lower kind of preventive, the
habits of the people are necessarily such as to hinder
an increase of food and thereby of population. When
Europe was less civilized, it was not more, but less
thickly peopled.<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c016'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>This argument seems to be weakened by one
consideration—that the poor in our day put more
into their idea of necessaries; they have a higher
standard of living than the poor 2000 years ago. It
might therefore be said with justice that over-population
(a peopling beyond the food) begins much sooner
with us than with them, for it begins at a point
much farther removed from starvation, and that
therefore with the ancients a given amount of food
would go farther and feed more. But, if we look
only to the poor in each case, the difference between
the ancient standard of comfort and the modern
is unhappily much smaller than the difference
between their meagre industrial resources and our
ample ones, for our powers of production have grown
far more rapidly than the comfort of our labouring
population. Such difference as there is in the
standards is only made possible by moral restraint,
which has a closer affinity with modern civilization
than with ancient or mediæval.<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c016'><sup>[230]</sup></a> The history of
modern civilization is largely the history of the gradual
victory of the third check over the two others; and,
as one of the chief allies of the third has been commercial
ambition, the victory of moral restraint, by
causing a larger industry, has caused in the end not
a smaller, but a larger population.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c016'><sup>[231]</sup></a> The increase by
being deferred has been made only the more certain
and permanent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The broad difference between a savage and a civilized
population is, that the positive checks prevail in
the one, the preventive in the other,—and between
ancient and modern civilizations, that vice and misery
prevail in the one, moral restraint in the other.<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c016'><sup>[232]</sup></a> Yet
every civilized nation in modern times has not only
passed through these three stages in the course of
its past history, but contains them all within it now
as a matter of observation. Its early history was
an endeavour after independence or bare life, its
later history an endeavour after full development;
but there are strata in it to which civilization
has not descended, and in which the struggle for
bare existence prevails, alongside of strata in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the struggle is towards ideals of commercial ambition
and social perfection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The view which Malthus takes of commercial ambition
is substantially that of Adam Smith. As
soon as commerce is separated from slavery, as soon
as wealth is a man’s own acquisition, got by the
sweat of his own brow, then the desire of wealth
has a new social aspect. It becomes what Adam
Smith calls “the natural desire of every man to better
his own condition;” and as such it creates modern
commercial society, as opposed both to the ancient
society built upon slavery, and to the feudal built
upon war.</p>

<p class='c007'>This <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis mediatrix reipublicæ</span></i>, the desire of rising
in the world, so glorified in the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite><a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c016'><sup>[233]</sup></a>
and in the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>,<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c016'><sup>[234]</sup></a> is really not easy
to define. It is a very composite motive; and
the same differences of race (whatever their origin),
which lead to differences of intellect and language
also affect a nation’s standard of comfort, as soon as
it can be said to have one. By the influence of good
climate and much intercourse with foreigners, along
with advantages of upbringing, and perhaps of race,
a nation of Southern Europe comes to put into its
notion of happiness a great many more elements than
a northern nation, which has to hew its model out of
much poorer materials. The Norwegian standard will
be simpler than the Parisian. But there is more
behind. The question is not simply one of like and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>unlike elements, or of many and few elements, but
of the treatment of them by the human subject.
The English notion of comfort differs from the French
in its elements, which are probably more in number
as well as other in quality, and have a third peculiarity
quite distinct from the other two, their effect
on the habits of the persons concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>French writers have noticed that the English
farmer works hard for such an income as will give
him the innumerable little luxuries of toilet, dinner-table,
and drawing-room, that make up the English
idea of comfort, while the French farmer works hard
that he may be able to buy another farm.<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c016'><sup>[235]</sup></a> The one
lives up to his income; and in his efforts to preserve
it he is enterprising and persevering; he is always
striving to rise to the class above him. The other,
on the contrary, is more content with his position in
society; and simply wishes to make it stronger, by
gaining more property. His willing privations in
time of plenty are rewarded by his secure provision
in time of want; he has always his land to sell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both are moved by the civilizing “desire to better
one’s own condition”; but it leads in the one case
to simple saving, the old stocking, the piece of land,
or the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rentes</span></i>, in the other to active using, the steam-plough
first, that the piano and pony-carriage may
follow afterwards. There is some truth in M. Taine’s
paradox, “The Englishman provides for the future
not by his savings but by his expenses.”<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c016'><sup>[236]</sup></a> If capitalizing
means using as well as saving, there is a sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>in which the French and English divide the two
functions between them.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is what prevents the economist from making
any exact predictions about the effect of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis mediatrix
reipublicæ</span></i>. He may, like Adam Smith, find it
doing good work in the undermining of feudalism,<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c016'><sup>[237]</sup></a>
and he may point out that at any rate it would
make a better guide to the world than military glory,
which means unhappiness to one-half the world, and
a very mingled happiness to the other half. But he
cannot predict its effect on men whose characters are
unknown to him. He cannot even tell whether a
man is wealthy or not, till he knows what his wants
are, for wealth exists to satisfy wants, wants change
with human progress, the notion of wealth expands
with civilization, and the luxuries of one age and
one man are the necessaries of another. It is impossible
to treat this relative question as if its
conditions were absolute, and to deal with men as
we would with figures on a slate. Two and two
do not always make four in such a case, but sometimes
five, and frequently only three. A new vista
of comfort spread before different men may stimulate
one, spoil another, and leave a third unmoved.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising then that the question, “By
what various modes is population kept to the level of
the food in the states of modern Europe?” is not a
simple one. On some grounds it would seem comparatively
easy to get the answer. There are figures
to be had, and in many cases a census; there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>general similarity of circumstances which produces a
general similarity of habits, and, therewith, of the movements
of population. But there is no invariable order
of mortality and generation. The rates of births and
deaths are not the same for all nations; they depend
on the conduct of human beings, and may differ not
only in different countries, but in different parts of the
same country. In the same way, we have no single
statistical criterion of the healthy state of a population,
just as it might be said we have no single criterion
of the commercial prosperity of a country, still less of
its happiness. The two former stand to the last as
the parts to the whole. A healthy population and a
prosperous trade are parts of the happiness of a nation,
though they do not constitute the whole of it. To
ascertain whether a nation is happy or not, we have to
take into account these two parts of happiness along
with many others. The parts in their turn consist of
many parts. We measure the state of trade not only
by imports and exports, railway, banking and Clearing
House returns, and the gains of the public revenue,
but by subscriptions to churches, charities, and schools,
by savings banks and benefit societies, sales of books,
pictures, and luxuries of all kinds, by the state of
workmen’s wages, by the poor-law returns, by the
number of marriages, emigrants, and recruits for the
army; and we could make little use of most of these
figures without the census returns and the reports of
the Registrar General. In the same way, to measure
the healthiness of a population and ascertain whether
it is safely under the level of its food, tending to pass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>beyond it, or simply rising up to it, and to ascertain
by what ways and means the process is going on, we
need instead of one single general criterion a whole
array of particular tests. It is in the infancy of
statistical science that men yield to appearances and
“suppose a greater uniformity in things than is
actually found there.”<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c016'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This was, for example, the failing of Johann Peter
Süssmilch, one of the earliest inquirers into the
movements of population. A book like Süssmilch’s
had the same relation to the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>
as astrology to astronomy, or alchemy to chemistry;
it prepared the way for the more accurate study.
Süssmilch first published his researches in 1761,
while the Seven Years’ War was still in progress.
He dedicated it to Frederick the Great, as became a
patriot and Church dignitary; and entitled it, <cite>The
Divine Plan in the Changes through which the Human
Race passes in Birth, Death, and Marriage</cite>. The Divine
plan is the one set forth in the exhortation to Noah
in Genesis—the peopling of the earth;<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c016'><sup>[239]</sup></a> and the book
tries to show the particular arrangements by which
the plan is carried out. One condition is, he says,
that fertility be greater than mortality; the births
must exceed the deaths. On an average at present
each marriage produces four children; and “the
present law of death” is on an average, taking town
and country together, 1 in 36; out of 36 men now
living, 1 must die every year. In the country it is
from 1 in 40 to 1 in 45; in the town, from 1 in 38
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>to 1 in 32. There is a yearly excess of births represented
by 1 in 10 and 5 in 10. The increase must
have been faster at first than it is now; and the
means God took to effect His end in each case was
the lengthening and shortening of human life. In the
times of Methuselah there must have been a very
different law of mortality, perhaps one death in a
hundred; the length of life was greater; and probably
the power of parentage lasted longer. The
average number of children might be about twenty
in a family instead of four; and the doubling of
population would take place in ten or twenty years,
instead of as now in seventy or eighty. Antediluvians
were long-lived because their long lives were
needed for the replenishment of the earth; and the
extreme length was shortened so soon as the time
came when the same end could be reached in other
ways. When we observe the remarkable adaptiveness
of man which enables him alone among the
creatures<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c016'><sup>[240]</sup></a> to live in any latitude, and when we
observe how he has been preserved while many
animals have become extinct, we need have no
doubt that the replenishment of the earth was really
the Divine purpose. It is remarkable too that,
though more sons are born than daughters, death
equalizes their numbers before mature life. The
“system” which prevails in the increase of man is
like the march of a military regiment, in which all
the men have their places, actions, and accoutrements
determined for them. The proportion of sons to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>daughters, and deaths to births, Süssmilch regards
as a tolerably fixed one; the discovery of unexpected
uniformities overjoys him greatly, and he regards
the man who first used the London bill of mortality
to detect these uniformities as a sort of statistical
Columbus. In short, his book is an economical
Théodicée, a long piece of pious deductive reasoning;
and it is curious to find Germany producing two such
optimistic books at a time when it was even further
from the millennium than its neighbours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts of Süssmilch, ill-sifted as they were, gave
Malthus a much firmer ground of reasoning than
the scanty patches of evidence about the population
of ancient and barbarous nations. He is at last in
the region of statistics as opposed to conjecture,
and in the region of the personal observation and
travel of men who were at least asking his own
questions. But the fate of the bills of mortality
and other records, in the hands of Price and
Wallace, to say nothing of Petty and Süssmilch,
shows how important was Malthus’ work as an
interpreter of statistics. Statistics were a novelty
in his day. As Adam Smith wrote on the <cite>Wealth
of Nations</cite> without any full statistics of the wealth,
and none at all of the population, of his own country,
Malthus wrote his first essay when there was no
census; and, for some time afterwards, so comparatively
isolated were the nations of Europe, that
to be at all certain of his facts, an author needed
to verify and collect them by journeying in person,
and seeing the scenes with his own eyes. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>essential work of an investigator Malthus did not
leave undone; and his chapters on the state of
population in modern European nations are to a
large extent a record of his own observations. He
went for a summer trip in 1799 with three college
friends, Dr. Edward Clarke, Mr. Cripps, and Mr.
Otter, afterwards Bishop of Chichester. They went
by Hamburg to Sweden, and there the party broke
up into two, Clarke and his pupil Cripps going
farther north, Otter and Malthus going on through
Norway to visit Finland and St. Petersburg.<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c016'><sup>[241]</sup></a> These
were the only European countries where English
travellers could easily make their way in those
years.<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c016'><sup>[242]</sup></a> In 1802 he saw France and Switzerland,<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c016'><sup>[243]</sup></a>
but seems not to have left the kingdom again till
1825, when the journey was taken for the sake of his
wife’s health, on the death of one of his children,
and he was little in the mood for investigations.
The tours of 1799 and 1802 are the only ones
that have left substantial traces on his economical
work.<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c016'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In all his travels he found the foreigner as ignorant
as the Englishman on the subject of population.
Only twice did he hear the truth expounded to
him; in Norway during his first tour, and in
Switzerland during his second. In the latter case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the enlightenment was confined to one individual;
but in the former the whole nation was wise.
While the Swedish Government was continually
crying for more people, and trying to “encourage
population,” the Norwegian Government and people
seemed to have understood that the first question
must be, “Are there means to feed more people?”
If not, then we multiply the nation without increasing
the joy. Of course there are cases where we
might thin down the nation and still less increase
the joy. Mere scantiness of numbers is no advantage
to a nation, any more than fewness of wants
to an individual; it may mean a low state of civilization,
in both cases. It is not by any means so
good for a country to be wasted by a pestilence as
to be opened up by a new trade. The denser the
population, the better;—so says Malthus himself;—but,
he adds, let it be a population of strong,
comfortable citizens, or let us stand by the small
numbers and the slow increase.</p>

<p class='c007'>Look now at Norway.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c016'><sup>[245]</sup></a> If we were dealing with
uncivilized times under the reign of positive checks,
we should expect an overflowing population, a large
body of poor, and in times of scarcity a great deal
of distress. There had been no wars for half a
century, the cold climate kept away epidemics, and
what else was left but famine to keep down the
population to the limits of the food? Vice was not
taken into the service, and emigration was seldom
practised then in these regions. But Malthus visited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the country in one of the hardest years ever known
in Europe, 1799, and found the Norwegians “wearing
a face of plenty and content, while their neighbours
the Swedes appeared to be starving.”<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c016'><sup>[246]</sup></a> He
found the death-rate lower in Norway than in any
country in Europe.<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c016'><sup>[247]</sup></a> The population, however, was
hardly increasing at all; and the proportion of marriages
to the whole numbers of the people was smaller
than in any country except Switzerland.<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c016'><sup>[248]</sup></a> The positive
check was largely superseded by the preventive.
The virtue of foresight, he says, is elsewhere forced
upon the upper classes by the smallness of their circle
and the fewness of openings in business or professions;
in Norway it is forced upon all classes alike by the
evident smallness of the country’s resources, and by
the peculiarities of the national industry. There is
almost no variety of occupation or division of labour.
The humbler classes are almost all “housemen”
(<i><span lang="sv" xml:lang="sv">husmänd</span></i>), labourers, who receive from a farmer in
quasi-feudal fashion a small house and a little piece
of land in return for occasional labour on his fields.
In other countries men may easily fall into the fallacy
of crediting the whole of the land with a greater
power of supporting people than the power possessed
by the sum of its parts. In the great towns of Central
Europe a man has perhaps some excuse for trusting
to the chapter of accidents; in the great variety of
occupations he may have some excuse for thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>there will surely be a vacancy for him, and he may
“e’en take Peggie.” Norway, however, is to manufacturing
countries what the country districts elsewhere
are to the towns elsewhere. In the country
districts an excess of population cannot be hidden,
and the superfluities must go to the towns. Those
who marry, therefore, when there is no vacancy for
them, do so with the alternatives of poverty or
migration clearly before their eyes. In Norway
every peasant, not to say every farmer, knows quite
certainly whether there is an opening for him or not,
and, if there is not, he cannot marry.<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c016'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The conditions of the problem were in this way
simplified, and the problem itself was satisfactorily
answered. The only districts where Malthus saw
signs of poverty were on the coast, where the people
live by fishing; the openings for a fisherman are not
so distinctly limited in their numbers as the openings
for a farmer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Time has united Norway and Sweden under one
king (1814), and Sweden now presents no unfavourable
contrast with Norway. Even in 1825 Malthus
wrote<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c016'><sup>[250]</sup></a> that the progress of agriculture and industry,
and the practice of vaccination, had caused a steady
and healthful increase of population since 1805.
He would be pleased to find too by the census that
the population of Norway had increased very greatly
in proportion to its poor. The improvement continues.
The paupers were about one per cent. of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the population in 1869 (when they were nearly five
per cent. in England), which seems to have meant a
decrease from previous years;<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c016'><sup>[251]</sup></a> but between 1865 and
1875 the population had increased fourteen per cent.
in spite of considerable emigration.<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c016'><sup>[252]</sup></a> Malthus would
have recognized with satisfaction that the nation had
been “either increasing the quantity or facilitating
the distribution” of its food,<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c016'><sup>[253]</sup></a> that is to say, improving
either its agriculture or its manufactures. It has
really done both. Though the growth of the population
has been greater in the centres of manufacture,
there has been progress also in the country districts.
Many of the old customs and laws that hampered
agriculture have ceased to exist.<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c016'><sup>[254]</sup></a> Malthus himself
says that, if Government would remove hindrances
to agriculture, and spread sound knowledge about it,
it would do more for the population of the country
than by establishing five hundred foundling hospitals.<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c016'><sup>[255]</sup></a>
He need not have confined his recommendation to agriculture;
and elsewhere he states the truth in broader
terms: “The true encouragement to marriage is the
high price of labour, and an increase of employments
which require to be supplied with proper hands.”<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c016'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
Remove hindrances to trade and spread sound knowledge
of it—that (in his view) is the way to increase
the quantity and facilitate the distribution of the
products of agriculture; and, to judge by results,
the Norwegian Government has followed it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Sweden,<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c016'><sup>[257]</sup></a> as it then was, furnished a striking contrast
to Norway. Malthus had the advantage there
of the earliest and most regular of European censuses,
beginning with the year 1748, and continued at
intervals first of three and then of five years. He
found that there was a large mortality, though the
conditions of life were superficially the same as in
Norway. The only explanation he could see was
that the size and shape of the country, as well as its
mode of government, did not so forcibly bring home
to the people the need of restraint as in Norway, while
at the same time the hindrances to good farming
were even more serious than in the smaller country.
From the very contiguity and general similarity of
the two countries, they proved Malthus’ point, by
the Method of Difference, almost as well as a deliberate
experiment could have done. It was not that
Norway had an absolutely small and Sweden an
absolutely large population; considerations of absolute
greatness or smallness never enter into this, if into
any, economical question. But Norway had a moderately
large population in proportion to her food,
while Sweden had in the same regard an excessive
population, a population which was sparely fed even
in average years, and decimated by famine and
disease in years below the average.</p>

<p class='c007'>Russia,<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c016'><sup>[258]</sup></a> which was the third scene of Malthus’
travels, had this in common with Norway and Sweden,
that the movement of its population was unlike that
of Central Europe, and that the eccentricity was due
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>to a clearly definable cause. In Norway the shape
and climate of the country and the fewness of the
available occupations forced the Government and the
people to restrain rather than to encourage the
increase of numbers; in Sweden, under conditions
less simple, the habits of the people conspired with a
false policy of the Government to produce an excessive
increase. In both cases we have something
different from the typical modern society of Central
Europe, with its full division of labour, its system
of large factories, and its extensive substitution of
machinery for hand labour. Russia was as old-fashioned
as Norway and Sweden in this respect;
and her physical vastness made her a difficult country
to know, in these days of slow communication. It
is not surprising that the statistics available in the
days of Malthus were open to grave suspicion. The
death-rate was given as 1 in 60, while in Norway
itself it had not been lower than 1 in 48, and it
is about 1 in 53 in England now, yet the number
of marriages and of births and the size of families
were no smaller than elsewhere.<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c016'><sup>[259]</sup></a> These facts by
themselves would simply suggest a great rate of
increase going on in the country concerned; and
Malthus allows that there is great scope for such in
Russia. But there was one other fact that strengthened
his doubts about the vital statistics of that
country; contrary to the experience of all other
countries, it was said that in Russia more women
were born than men. In others, more men are born
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>than women, and the numbers are only equalized
gradually, by the greater risks of masculine life, as the
years go on. In Sweden, with a climate not milder
than Russia, this had long been observed.<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c016'><sup>[260]</sup></a> It turned
out on inquiry that the Russian method of registration
allowed loopholes for more omissions in the deaths than
in the births. Public institutions, including hospitals
and prisons, had been left out of account; and the
deaths in the foundling hospitals were alone quite
sufficient to alter the average very significantly for the
worse. Malthus’ hatred of Foundling hospitals is only
equalled by his dislike of Poor laws. The idea of
such institutions was, like that of Pitt’s Poor Bill,
purely philanthropic. They were “to enrich the
country from year to year with an increasing number
of healthy, active, and industrious burghers,”<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c016'><sup>[261]</sup></a> that
would otherwise be doomed to death soon after
birth. It used to be said of the bounty, granted by
the Government of India, on slaughtered snakes, that
it really kept up the supply, for the natives bred them
to catch the bounty. The foundling hospitals had
an opposite effect. They were meant to multiply and
they tended to destroy. They encouraged a mother
to desert her child at the precise time it needed the
minute and careful attention that only a mother can
give. “It is not to be doubted that, if the children
received into these hospitals had been left to the
management of their parents, taking the chance of all
the difficulties in which they might be involved, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>much greater proportion of them would have reached
the age of manhood and have become useful members
of the state.”<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c016'><sup>[262]</sup></a> But, besides increasing the mortality
of children, they injure the very “mainspring of population”<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c016'><sup>[263]</sup></a>
by discouraging marriage and encouraging
irregularities. In his talks with his father, Malthus
had no doubt discussed the propriety of Rousseau’s
conduct in sending his children to the Paris Foundling
Hospital. He would certainly have declared against
Rousseau. To those who argue that the foundling
basket may prevent child-murder, he answers that an
occasional murder from “false [?] shame” is saved at
a very dear price by the violation of “the best and
most useful feelings of the human heart,” which the
existence of such an institution teaches to the poor.
To relieve parents of the care of their children is
bad for the parents,<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c016'><sup>[264]</sup></a> because it takes away from
them a responsibility essential to full citizenship and
civilizing in its effects on human character;—and it is
unjust to their fellow-citizens, because, like the Poor
Laws, it relieves one portion of society (in this case
rather the worst than the poorest) at the expense of
all the rest, and finds a career for pauper apprentices
to the prejudice of independent workmen and
their children.<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c016'><sup>[265]</sup></a> In the third place, like the Poor
Laws, it promises an impossibility—to relieve all that
come. If children are to be received without limit,
the resources for maintaining them should be without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>limit; otherwise an excessive mortality is quite
unavoidable.<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c016'><sup>[266]</sup></a> The second reason is no doubt an
economical commonplace; it is the first and third
that are most characteristic of Malthus. He never
forgets that human wants and human wills are an
element in every economical phenomenon, and therefore
considers that the effects of character on actions
and of actions on character are of great economical
importance. He will not allow that it can be right,
even for a Government, to make promises that cannot
be performed. These two plain principles give the
tone to the later chapters, where he interprets for
us the comparatively full statistics of Central Europe
and our own England.<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c016'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The law of population may be described (though
not in the exact words of Malthus) as among
savage peoples the tendency to increase beyond the
food, and among civilized to increase up to it. So
Professor Rogers founds his estimate of the numbers
of the English people in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries on the principle that “there were
generally as many people existing in this country
as there have been, on an average, quarters of wheat
to feed them with.”<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c016'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of highly progressive modern nations
such statements would be beyond the truth; and
we must either say that they tend to increase not
beyond but along with the food, or else we must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>define food itself very widely. In the first case
“tendency” will mean the abstract possibility depending
on the one physiological condition; in the
others it is the concrete nett possibility depending
on all the various conditions together. In a general
preface to his chapters on Central Europe, Malthus
quite recognizes these distinctions and warns us
against exact statements. “It seldom happens,” he
says, “that the increase of food and of population
is uniform; and when the circumstances of a country
are varying either from this cause or from any change
in the national habits with respect to prudence and
cleanliness, it is evident that a proportion which is
true at one period will not be at another. Nothing
is more difficult than to lay down rules on this
subject that do not admit of exceptions.”<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c016'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After this it is hard to believe what he tells us
elsewhere, that “the only criterion of a real and
permanent increase in the population of any country
is the increase of the means of subsistence.”<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c016'><sup>[270]</sup></a> It
would be at best a negative criterion and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ
non</span></i>,—there can be no increase of numbers without
increase of food,—though even then it is not true of
a “forced population,” living down to a lower food.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c016'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
But there clearly may be an increase of food without
an increase of numbers, unless the character of the
people is such that they do nothing with the food
except increase by it. Therefore, though, within
certain wide limits fixed for us by invariable qualities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>of human nature, predictions are justifiable on the
ground of the law of population<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c016'><sup>[272]</sup></a> or any other
economical laws, none that specify a particular course
of action as a result of a particular event are trustworthy,
till we know the character of the people
concerned.<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c016'><sup>[273]</sup></a> Malthus always tries to bear this in
mind; and, when he tells us that the lists of
births, marriages, and deaths in Mid Europe give
more information about its internal economy than
the observations of the wisest travellers,<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c016'><sup>[274]</sup></a> he is
at once interpreting those figures in the light of
a principle, and interpreting the principle by means
of the figures. This appears when we look at
the four chief conclusions of the general chapter
in question. The first is the proposition that in
the present state of our industrial civilization the
marriages depend very closely on the deaths, and the
births on the marriages.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c016'><sup>[275]</sup></a> Montesquieu says that
wherever there is room for two persons to live
comfortably a marriage will certainly take place.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c016'><sup>[276]</sup></a>
In old countries experience is usually against any
sure expectation of the means of supporting a
family; the place for a new marriage is only made
by the dissolution of an old. As a rule therefore
the number of annual marriages is regulated by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>number of annual deaths. “Death is the most
powerful of all the encouragements to marriage,”<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c016'><sup>[277]</sup></a>
while on the other hand the marriages are a frequent
cause of the deaths. In almost every country there
is too great a frequency of marriages, which causes
as it were a forced mortality. Which of these two
mutual influences is the more powerful depends on
circumstances. In last century the proportion of
annual marriages to inhabitants was in Holland
generally as 1 in 107 or 108. But in twenty-two
Dutch villages it was as 1 in 64. Süssmilch explained
this anomaly by the number of new trades
in Holland and the new openings for workmen.
Malthus would not have denied this possibility, his
startling paradox about death being only a particular
case of the general principle that “the high price of
labour is the real encouragement to marriage.”<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c016'><sup>[278]</sup></a> But
in this case the explanation ought to have applied
to all Holland if to any part of it. The real
reason came out when Malthus observed that the
mortality, which was as 1 in 36 in Holland generally,
was as 1 in 22 in those villages. The additional
marriages did not really increase the population.
They were caused by the high number of deaths
which provided openings for the living; and the high
number of deaths was caused by the unhealthiness
of the region and of its prevailing industries, which
were manufacturing rather than agricultural. The
choice in every large population is between having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>many lives which end soon, and few which last long.
Greater healthiness in the conditions of life will result
in the latter. We find as a matter of fact that, where
there has been the sanitary improvement as well as
simply the “replenishment” of an old country, the
marriage rate goes down at the expense of the death-rate,
and there is an economy of human life and
suffering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Putting the parts of his exposition together, we
get something like a deductive scheme of the growth
of population in old countries under an industrial
revolution like that of the eighteenth century. The
first effect of the discovery of new minerals, and
even (with some qualifications) of the invention of
new machines, is to provide new employment for
working men, and many new opportunities for marriage;
the proportion of marriages therefore becomes
at once greater without any alteration (from this
cause at least) in the death-rate. But, when the
first burst of progress has passed, and the succeeding
improvement is not by leaps and bounds, but at a
uniform rate, then the proportion of marriages will
decrease, as the new situations are filled up and
there is no more room for an increasing population.
Once the country is really “old” in the sense of
fully peopled and unprovided with new sources of
employment, then the marriages will be regulated
principally by the deaths, and (the habits of the
people remaining the same) will bear much the
same proportion to each other at one time as at
another. It is not, however, exactly the same proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>for all old countries, simply because the
habits and standards of living are different, to say
nothing of healthiness or unhealthiness of climate
and occupation. For similar reasons it is not the
same for towns as for country districts.<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c016'><sup>[279]</sup></a> “A general
measure of mortality for all countries taken together”
would be useless if procurable; but it cannot be
procured.<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c016'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Habits, however, are sufficiently fixed to make us
certain that “any <em>direct</em> encouragements to marriage
must be accompanied by an increased mortality.”<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c016'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
They spur a willing horse. Montesquieu and Süssmilch,
although they both enlarge on the evils of
over-population, still think it a statesman’s duty
to be, like Augustus and Trajan, the father of his
people by encouraging their marriages. But, if many
marriages mean many deaths, the princes or statesmen
who should really succeed in this patriotic policy
might more justly be called the destroyers than the
fathers of their people.<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c016'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If Malthus had been asked how a prince could
best become a real <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pater patriæ</span></i>, he would have
named two or three ways. The prince might direct
his mind to the improvement of industry, especially
of agriculture.<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c016'><sup>[283]</sup></a> He might circulate news and knowledge
on these subjects;<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c016'><sup>[284]</sup></a> or, as we should say now,
he might institute agricultural exhibitions, and regular
agricultural statistics of home and foreign production.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>He would in this way increase the population by
helping to increase the food.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, he might benefit trade everywhere
by giving it the security of good government
and impartial justice, a peaceful foreign policy and
light taxation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the third place, he might, together with all
these, encourage Emigration. Malthus devotes a
special chapter of the essay to this subject; and,
though the chapter is in a later part of his work
(Bk. III. ch. iv.<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c016'><sup>[285]</sup></a>), this seems the best place to touch
on the subject. Emigration, he says, is, apart from
political distinctions, the same thing as migration;
and, if it is economically good for a man to go from
a poor land at his door to a rich in the next county,
it cannot be economically bad for him to go from a
poor district of his own country to a rich across the
sea. The mere length of the journey or the difference
of latitude does not affect the economical nature of
the change.</p>

<p class='c007'>Economical motives, however, have come very late
in all the great European emigrations. It was not
the desire of finding room for the over-crowded
families at home, but desire of the metal gold, or
else it was the simple love of adventure, or ambition
of conquest, that first sent the Spanish, Portuguese,
English, and Dutch to the far East and far West.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c016'><sup>[286]</sup></a>
“These passions enabled the first adventurers to
triumph” over obstacles that would have deterred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>quiet industrial emigrants, “but in many instances
in a way to make humanity shudder, and to defeat
the very end of emigration. Whatever may be the
character of the Spanish inhabitants of Mexico and
Peru at the present moment, we cannot read the
accounts of the first conquests of these countries
without feeling strongly that the race destroyed was,
in moral worth as well as numbers, superior to the
race of their destroyers.” The settlers that followed
on the heels of these pioneers, though they were
more like real emigrants, went unskilfully to work.
They seemed to expect that “the moral and mechanical
habits” which suited the old country would suit
the new,<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c016'><sup>[287]</sup></a> and everything would go on as it did at
home. At first therefore there would be a redundant
population<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c016'><sup>[288]</sup></a> in the new country rather than in the
old, for, however great the possible produce of the
colony, the actual produce would be less than the
wants of the new-comers on their first arrival. To
all this must be added the fact that, though economically
a far and a near place are alike, they are very
different to the sentiments of men. Patriotism is
no fault, and the breaking of home ties is a real evil
to the individuals, however beneficial the emigration
may be to the nation. Men are slow to move, not
only from the uncertain prospects of success, but from
that <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis inertiæ</span></i> in man which is always counteracting
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis mediatriæ</span></i> of commercial ambition. In addition,
therefore, to the mere uneasiness of poverty and the
desire of getting a living, there is need of some spirit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of enterprise, to make men willing and successful
emigrants.<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c016'><sup>[289]</sup></a> Those who felt distress most would often
have been the most helpless in a new country;
they needed leaders who were “urged by the spirit
of avarice or enterprise, or of religious or political
discontent, or were furnished with means and support
by Government;” otherwise, “whatever degree of
misery they might suffer in their own country from
the scarcity of subsistence, they would be absolutely
unable to take possession of any of those uncultivated
regions of which there is such an extent on the earth.”
Emigration then (according to Malthus) is not likely
to happen unless political discontent and extreme
poverty have brought the emigrants to such a plight
that it is better for their country as well as for themselves
that they should go. “There are no fears so
totally ill-grounded as the fears of depopulation from
emigration.”<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c016'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Emigration is not even a cure for an
over-population; and is much recommended only
because little adopted. Gaps made in the population
of old countries are soon filled up; room found in the
new is soon occupied. If emigration is proposed as a
means of securing an absolutely unrestricted increase
of population by placing old countries in the position
of new colonies, the hope will be soon and for ever
cut off.<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c016'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the end of his life, Malthus had an opportunity
of explaining his views on this subject to an
audience of statesmen. He appeared as a witness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>before the Select Committee<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c016'><sup>[292]</sup></a> of the House of Commons
“to inquire into the expediency of encouraging emigration
from the United Kingdom,” and his influence
is traceable in their Reports. They reported<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c016'><sup>[293]</sup></a> that
there had been in the United Kingdom a “redundant
population,” in Ireland agricultural, in Scotland and
England manufacturing; that one cause of it had
been the unavoidable displacement of hand labour by
machinery;<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c016'><sup>[294]</sup></a> that meanwhile the British colonies in
America, Africa, and Australia had few men and
plenty of land, and that it would benefit the whole
empire if parishes could convert their probable or
actual paupers into emigrants, always provided that
the remaining population could be induced not to

“The testimony” (said the Committee in their third
Report<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c016'><sup>[296]</sup></a>) “which was uniformly given by the practical
witnesses has been confirmed in the most absolute
manner by that of Mr. Malthus, and your Committee
cannot but express their satisfaction at finding that
the experience of facts is thus strengthened throughout
by general reasoning and scientific principles.”
They were more disposed than their witness himself
to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i> reasoning, and in many of their leading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>questions he declined to follow them.<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c016'><sup>[297]</sup></a> But he agreed
with their main conclusions, allowing that under
certain conditions it would be even a financial advantage
to remove unemployed workmen to the colonies
rather than suffer them to become paupers at home,
and adding, that, if he was against the admission of
any legal claim to relief in ordinary cases of pauperism,
still more would he be against it when the
pauper had before him the alternative of assisted
emigration.<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c016'><sup>[298]</sup></a> His own view of emigration had not
changed since he wrote in 1803. It was to him a
partial remedy; and it is more useful when spontaneously
adopted by the people<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c016'><sup>[299]</sup></a> than when pressed
on them by their Government. Under the torture
of the question he conceded no more.<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c016'><sup>[300]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As a temporary expedient, the essay tells us,<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c016'><sup>[301]</sup></a>
“with a view to the more general cultivation of the
earth and the wider extension of civilization, it seems
to be both useful and proper,” and is to be encouraged,
or at least not prevented, by Governments. All
depends on the rate of wages. If wages were high
enough to enable people to live with what they
counted reasonable comfort at home, we may be sure
their domestic and patriotic ties would be strong
enough to keep them there. The complaint that
emigration raises wages is most unreasonable. At
the utmost it prevents wages from falling too low,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and helps to heal the mischief caused by fluctuations
in trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall find at a later stage that Malthus is
keenly aware of the unhappiness caused in modern
industrial societies by changes in the demand for
goods, occurring even in the natural (or uninterrupted)
course of trade. A movement in favour of
emigration in 1806 and 1807 led him to insert a
paragraph in the fourth edition of his essay which
explains the relation of emigration to these changes.
He accepts the statement of Adam Smith, that “the
demand for men, like that for any other commodity,
necessarily regulates the production of men;”<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c016'><sup>[302]</sup></a> but
he adds (as Cairnes added later) that it takes some
little time to bring more labour into the market when
there is demand for it, and some little time to check
the supply when once it has begun to flow.<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c016'><sup>[303]</sup></a> A
family may be reared to catch high wages, and the
high wages may have gone before the family has
arrived at maturity. Malthus distinguishes between
a normal or slight “oscillation” of this kind, and an
excessive redundancy caused by an unusual stimulus
to production—the stimulus, for example, of the
foreign wars and the foreign trade of the years before
Waterloo. In the normal case we must submit to
the inevitable; in the exceptional we may find an
outlet in emigration. No doubt, even if there be no
emigration, in the long run the labour market will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>right itself; but the process will be a very painful
one to the workmen concerned. Emigration is the
humane and politic remedy.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some cases, such as Norway and the uplands of
Switzerland,<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c016'><sup>[304]</sup></a> there would seem to be no need for
Government to teach the people to emigrate. Circumstances
should do it for them; but human beings
are influenced by habit and “chance” as much as
by any deliberate motive, commercial or otherwise.
In the Swiss uplands, as Malthus knew them, “a
habit of emigration depended not only on situation
but often on accident.” Three or four successful
emigrations “have frequently given a spirit of enterprise
to a whole village, and three or four unsuccessful
ones a contrary spirit.”<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c016'><sup>[305]</sup></a> This is illustrated by the
contrast of two parishes, both in the Canton de Vaud,
St. Cergues in the Jura, and Leysin<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c016'><sup>[306]</sup></a> in the Bernese
Alps near Aigle. The movements of population in
Leysin puzzled M. Muret, the Swiss economist, who
drew up a paper on the depopulation of Switzerland
for the Economical Society of Berne in the year 1766.
He found that in this parish of four hundred people
there were born every year on an average only eight
children, whereas, elsewhere in Canton de Vaud, to
the same number of people eleven (in Lyonnais
sixteen) children were a common proportion. The
difference, he observed, disappeared by the age of
twenty, when, if we may say so, the difference died
off, the eight in Leysin being healthier than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>eleven (or sixteen) elsewhere. Muret infers from
this, that “in order to maintain in all places the
proper equilibrium of population, God has wisely
ordered things in such a manner as that the force of life
in each country should be in the inverse ratio of its
fecundity.”<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c016'><sup>[307]</sup></a> There is, however, no need to suppose
a miracle. The fact was simply that the place and
the employments were healthy, that the people had
not formed habits of emigration, that their resources
were stationary, that, therefore, they married late, had
few children, and were long-lived.<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c016'><sup>[308]</sup></a> The subsisting
marriages were to the annual births as 12 to 1; the
births were to the living population as 1 to 49; and
the number of persons above sixteen were to those
below as 3 to 1.<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c016'><sup>[309]</sup></a> This would show that mere number
of births is no criterion of the size of a population,
for it took only about half of the ordinary number
of births to keep up a population of four hundred in
the parish of Leysin. In St. Cergues the subsisting
marriages were to the annual births as 4 to 1 (instead
of 12 to 1 as at Leysin), the births were to the living
population as 1 to 26, and the number of persons
above and below sixteen just equal. That is to say,
St. Cergues had nearly twice as many births a year
in proportion to the population, and more than twice
as many marriages; but, instead of three-fourths of
its living population being above sixteen (as at Leysin),
those above and those below were equal in number,
and St. Cergues had a smaller proportion of adults
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>than Leysin. On the other hand, the death-rate was
nearly the same; the healthiness was nearly as great.
How came it then that the population of St. Cergues
was only one hundred and seventy-one, as against the
four hundred and five of Leysin? What became of
the children born? Seeing that they did not die,
and did not appear on the registers of the living,
we infer that they left their native village; that
is all. The situation of the parish of St. Cergues,
on the high road from Paris to Geneva, suggested
emigration; and, as a matter of fact, the place had
become, like most highland hamlets, a breeding-place
for the lowlands and the manufacturing towns. The
annual drain of adults made room for the favoured
remnant to marry and have large families. Even
Leysin, though it lay on no high road, might conceivably
(says Malthus) have exchanged its stay-at-home
character for a habit of emigration, and might then
have doubled its birth-rate without raising the death-rate.
It is one of the fallacies of old statisticians to
infer a large population from a high birth-rate; in
an old country, if the rate of births is high in comparison
with the number of living inhabitants, it
means either many deaths or much emigration.</p>

<p class='c007'>The people of an old country, if they cannot or
will not emigrate, must, according to Malthus, either
look for a high death-rate or accustom themselves
to late marriages. M. Muret’s figures showed that
many cantons of Switzerland had adopted this last
course in the eighteenth century. In the Canton de
Vaud, for example, the proportion of marriages to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>living inhabitants (1 to 140) was lower than in Norway
itself. In a pastoral country the limits of human
resources are so obvious that the people cannot fail to
be impressed with the need of limiting their numbers.
Pastoral industry, again, feeds more than it employs,<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c016'><sup>[310]</sup></a>
and the unemployed must look for employment elsewhere.
This was one reason why there were so
many Swiss in foreign service. “When a father
has more than one son, those who are not wanted
on the farm are powerfully tempted to enrol themselves
as soldiers, or emigrate in some other way, as
the only chance to enable them to marry.”<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c016'><sup>[311]</sup></a> Malthus
was a little disappointed with the condition of the
Swiss peasantry when he saw them in 1803. Perhaps,
he says, they were still suffering from the wars
in which the “Helvetic Republic” had been involved
by its French allies; but more probably they were
suffering from the unwise attempts of their Government
in the previous century to “encourage” what
they then thought was a declining population.<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c016'><sup>[312]</sup></a> The
peasant who guided Malthus to the sources of the
Orbe<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c016'><sup>[313]</sup></a> talked freely to him on the poverty of the
district, which he ascribed to early and imprudent
marriages, “le vice du pays”; he would have a law
passed to prevent a man marrying till he was forty,
and a woman till she was elderly. He said that at
one time the introduction of stone polishing had given
the people high wages and led them to expect constant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>employment; changes of fashion<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c016'><sup>[314]</sup></a> had helped to drive
the industry away, but the habits taught by it had
remained so fast rooted in the people that emigration
itself brought no relief to their overflowing numbers.
But this self-taught Malthusian had not learned his
lesson perfectly. He fancied that the fertile lands
of the low countries, with their abundance of corn
and employments, could never experience the evil
of over-population. This was true only in the
unhappy sense that they had greater unhealthiness
and a greater mortality, providing room for early
marriages and many births.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easy to see that Malthus over-valued his
prize. The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pons asinorum</span></i> of the subject is the
doctrine that over-population is not a question of
absolute numbers or absolute quantity of food and
fertility of soil, but of the numbers in relation to
the food, in whatever place or time; and the young
peasant had not crossed it.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the order of his writing Malthus follows the
order of his travels, and takes France<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c016'><sup>[315]</sup></a> after Switzerland.
France presents us with facts of an almost
unique kind. But before the Revolution it had no
trustworthy parish registers to show to the English
inquirer; and Malthus would not have lingered over
it, if in 1802 the public mind had not been perplexed
by a riddle, about French population and its increase
during war, of which he had the key.<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c016'><sup>[316]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The essay is not meant for a mere history, and its
author is not careful to be full in his historical details
if he has a body of facts sufficient for his purpose.
He even says, about some conjectures of his own
based on French figures, that he had only adopted
the figures for the sake of illustration, and had not
supposed them to be strictly true. “It will be but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of little consequence if any of the facts or calculations
which have been assumed in the course of this chapter
should turn out to be false. The reader will see that
the reasonings are of a general nature, and may be
true though the facts taken to illustrate them may be
inapplicable.”<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c016'><sup>[317]</sup></a> This is not a wary admission. Nevertheless,
the chapter on France is one of the most
telling in the essay. The substance of it may be
stated very shortly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It has been seen,” he says, “in many of the
preceding chapters, that the proportions of births,
deaths, and marriages are extremely different in
different countries, and there is the strongest reason
for believing that they are very different in the same
country at different periods and under different circumstances.”<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c016'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
The truth of this remark is borne
out not only by the contrast between the France and
the Switzerland of that time, but, as we shall find,
by the contrast between the France of 1803 and the
France of to-day. It is not singular that Malthus
should (wrongly) expect the Swiss to become his
pupils more easily than the French, for in his day
both the mortality and the number of marriages
were greater in France than in Switzerland.<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c016'><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>He spends most pains in illustrating the contrast
between the France before the Revolution and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>France at the Peace of Amiens. In many ways it
was fortunate that he confined himself to the Republican
period. It was the time when the moral position
of France was highest, and she was warring not for
conquest but for defence. Switzerland had exemplified
the fact that Emigration does not permanently
check population, but, on the whole, encourages it.
France, at the time chosen, exemplified the fact that
even the most destructive Wars have a similar effect
on the growth of numbers. What Malthus had
proved more or less deductively in regard to ancient
nations he was able to show more inductively by
statistics in regard to modern. Great surprise was
expressed in the early days of this century that, in
spite of her enormous losses, France had not diminished
in population. Malthus says she had rather
increased than diminished. According to the estimate
of the Constituent Assembly, which was confirmed
by the calculations of Necker, the population in 1792,
before the war, was 26,000,000. In 1801 it seems,
from the returns of the Prefects, to have been about
28,000,000.<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c016'><sup>[320]</sup></a> In ten years the increase had been
2,000,000, or 200,000 a year. Yet at a medium calculation
France, in addition to the ordinary deaths, had
lost by the war about 1,000,000 of men up to that
time,<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c016'><sup>[321]</sup></a> or 100,000 a year. How, on the principles
of Malthus, were the two facts to be reconciled?</p>

<p class='c007'>To reconcile them he shows, first, how, according
to the figures given by Frenchmen themselves, the
numbers of the unmarried survivors at home were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>more than enough to have kept up in case of necessity
the old number of marriages and the old rate of
increase; second, how from general principles there
was a presumption in favour of a rapid increase at
such a time; and third, how the social and industrial
conditions of the French people since the Revolution
were favourable to an increase of population. First,
then, he shows that the entire body of unmarried
persons was large enough in spite of the war to fill
the vacancies and keep up the old rate of increase.
The body of the unmarried is formed by the “accumulation”
year by year of the numbers of persons,
rising to marriageable age, who are not married (or
say briefly of the marriageable unmarried, including
widows and widowers). This accumulation will only
stop when the yearly accessions thereto are no more
than equal to the yearly mortality therein. The size
of this body will therefore vary with the character of
the particular nation considered. In the Canton de
Vaud it was equal to the whole number of the
married; but in France both the mortality and the
marriage rate were higher than in Switzerland, and
the unmarried were therefore a smaller fraction of
the total numbers. Assuming from the French
authorities<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c016'><sup>[322]</sup></a> a certain birth and death-rate, and assuming
from the same authorities that the unmarried
men for the period before the Revolution were one
and a half millions out of five millions that were
marriageable, it would appear that every year there
were 600,000 persons arriving at the marriageable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>age, of whom (since about 220,000 is the annual
number of marriages) 440,000 marry. The surplus
of unmarried is therefore 160,000 persons, or about
80,000 men. It follows that for war purposes (if
mere numbers be considered) the reserve fund of men
would be nearly one and a half millions, and every
new annual surplus of 80,000 youths above eighteen
might be taken for military service without any
diminution in the number of marriages.<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c016'><sup>[323]</sup></a> As a
matter of fact, it is putting the case somewhat
strongly to suppose as many as 600,000 to be taken
for service in the first instance, and 150,000 additional
troops to keep up the supply every year. But this
would still leave in the first instance nearly 900,000
for the reserve fund, which with the annual 80,000
could bear a drain on it of 150,000 for ten years, and
leave a balance of 200,000 altogether, or 20,000 a
year. In other words, there would be room for an
increase in the number of marriages of nearly 20,000.
It would not be miraculous then if the French population
should continue to increase in the face of great
losses in war, for the increase before the war had been
very much less than the greatest possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the second place, the circumstances of the
civilian population made an increase very likely.
Many out of the reserve fund of unmarried men will
in the course of ten years be past the military age,
but not past the age of marriage. The 150,000
recruits would probably be taken from the 300,000
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>who every year rose to marriageable age, and the
marriages would be kept up from the older unmarried
men, in the scarcity of younger husbands. It may
be remembered, too, that in the early years of the
war so many youths married prematurely to avoid
service,<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c016'><sup>[324]</sup></a> that the Directory were obliged (in 1798) to
extend the conscription to the married men. But
even when the husbands were removed to the war
the marriages were not necessarily childless, and
would thus, at the least, be a means of adding to the
people’s numbers that did not exist before the Revolution.
The facility of divorce, too, though bad both
in morals and in politics, would at least, in the
existing scarcity of men, act somewhat like polygamy,
and make the number of children greater in proportion
to the number of husbands. It is said, too, that
there were more natural children born in France after
the Revolution than before it; and, since the peasants
were better off after it than before it, there was a
better chance that more of the children than formerly
should survive.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the third place, there is no doubt, says Malthus,
that the division of the domain lands and the creation
(or at least the multiplication) of peasant properties
have had a great influence both on wealth and on
population. They add to population more than to
wealth, for they increase the gross produce of food
at the expense of the nett surplus. “If all the
land of England were divided into farms of £20 a
year, we should probably be more populous than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>we are at present, but as a nation we should be
extremely poor. We should be almost without disposable
revenue, and should be under a total inability
of maintaining the same number of manufactures or
collecting the same taxes as at present.”<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c016'><sup>[325]</sup></a> But the
division of lands was at least in favour of the gross
produce, and even the passing traveller was inclined
to think, from the appearance of the fields and the
style of the field labour, that, however severely the
manufacturing industry of France might have suffered
during the war, her agriculture had rather gained
than lost.<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c016'><sup>[326]</sup></a> The absence of so many strong men with
the armies would not only raise wages at home and
make the labourers better off, but by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tanto</span></i>
lessening the demand for food and taking from those
at home the burden of supporting so many men,
would not raise the price of food with the wages,
but would allow real wages to rise. This would
co-operate with political causes in making the people
desert the towns for the country, and thereby it
would reduce the death-rate, which is always higher
in towns than in the country. It is attested by
Arthur Young (no friend to the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>)
that the high mortality of France before the Revolution
(according to Necker 1 in 30) was caused by an
over-population which the changes at the Revolution
tended to remove. The probability is, therefore, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the births increased and the deaths decreased during
the ten years after the Revolution; and there could
be no difficulty in understanding the increase of
population in spite of the war. In the later editions
of the essay<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c016'><sup>[327]</sup></a> Malthus confesses that his French
figures need revision; the returns of the Prefects
for 1801–2 and other Government papers had given
a smaller proportion of births than he had thought
probable, for the period before the Revolution. But
(he remarks) the Prefects’ returns do not embrace
the earlier years of the Revolution, precisely the
time when the encouragement to marriage would be
greatest and the proportion of births highest. In
any case they show that the population of France
is not less but greater since the Revolution. If in
the latter part of this period the increase was affected
by the decrease of deaths rather than by increase of
births, they not only leave his position untouched,
but give him a result that would highly please him.
Certainly in England and in Switzerland, and probably
in every European country, the rate of mortality
has decreased in the last two hundred years, through
the greater healthiness of the conditions of life; and
it is not at all surprising that a population should
be kept up or even made to increase with a smaller
proportion of births, deaths, and marriages than before.<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c016'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The French labouring classes at the beginning of
the Revolution were seventy-six per cent. worse fed,
clothed, and supported than their fellows in England.<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c016'><sup>[329]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Their wages were 10<em>d.</em> a day (as compared with
1<em>s.</em> 5<em>d.</em>), while the price of corn was about the same;
but their condition and their remuneration had been
decidedly improved by the Revolution and the
division of the national domains. Wages in money
(since Young wrote) had risen to 1<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> a day; and,
according to some authorities, the real wages had
become even higher than in England.<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c016'><sup>[330]</sup></a> The new
distribution of wealth had been followed by an
immense increase in the production of it, shared by
the producers themselves, and making France immensely
stronger as a nation either for offence or
defence.<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c016'><sup>[331]</sup></a> Such an improvement in the condition of
the people would naturally be followed by diminution
in the deaths; and a diminution in the deaths must
lead either to an increase of population or to a
decrease in the marriages and births. The latter
(which is presumably an increase of moral restraint)
has followed. In the ten years after the Peace of
Amiens the population seems to have increased only
at a very slow rate. “There is perhaps no proposition
more incontrovertible than this, that in two
countries, in which the rate of increase, the natural
healthiness of climate, and the state of towns and
manufactures are supposed to be nearly the same, the
one in which the pressure of poverty is the greatest
will have the greatest proportion of births, deaths,
and marriages,” and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>.<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c016'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus’ survey of population in France applies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>only to his own lifetime, and indeed only to the
earlier part of that. To do him full justice we must
place his picture of the real losses of war alongside
of his description of the compensations.</p>

<p class='c007'>The constant tendency of population to increase
up to the limits of the food may be interpreted (in
the case of war) as the tendency of the births in a
country to supply the vacancies made by death.
The breaches are not permanent; they are among the
reparable as distinguished from the irreparable mischiefs
of war. But this does not, from a moral or
political aspect, afford the slightest excuse for the
misery caused thereby to the existing inhabitants.</p>

men who died, but it is a deterioration, for the time
being, of the quality of the whole people; they will
consist of more than the normal proportion of women

women who in ordinary times would have remained

begins to exhaust the reserve of unmarried persons,
and the annual demands are in excess of the number
annually rising to marriageable age, then of course
war will actually diminish population.<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c016'><sup>[334]</sup></a> Till that
point is reached, war may alter the units and spoil
the quality of the population, but will not lessen its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>total volume. Sir Francis Ivernois, from whom
Malthus took some of his figures, went too far in
the other direction when he told us we must not look
so much at the deaths in battle or in hospital, when
we are counting up the destructive effects of war
or revolution, as at the remoter results; “the number
of men war has killed is of much less importance
than the number of children whom it has prevented
and will still prevent from coming into the world.”
He supposes one million of men to have been lost in
the Revolution itself, and one and a half millions in its
wars; and he says that, if only two millions of these
had been married, they would have needed to have had
six children each in order that a number of children
equal to the number of their parents (<em>i. e.</em> four millions)
should be alive thirty-nine years afterwards. We
ought, he thinks, to mourn not only for the two and a
half millions of men killed, but for the twelve millions
whom their death prevented from being born. To
which Malthus wisely answers that the slain, being
full-grown men, reared at no little cost to themselves
and their country, may be fitly mourned, but not the
unborn twelve millions, whose appearance in the
world would only have sent or kept a corresponding
number out of it,—and “if in the best-governed
country in Europe we were to mourn the posterity
which is prevented from coming into being, we should
always wear the habit of grief.”<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c016'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If Sir Francis Ivernois could have foreseen the
history of French population for seventy years after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the time when he wrote, he would have had more
reason to utter his curious lament.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The effect of the Revolution,” wrote Malthus in
1817, “has been to make every person depend more
upon himself and less upon others. The labouring
classes have therefore become more industrious, more
saving, and more prudent in marriage than formerly;
and it is quite certain that without these effects the
Revolution would have done nothing for them.”<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c016'><sup>[336]</sup></a> The
country districts which took the least active part in
the Revolution have been the most resolute in conserving
the results of it. Over-population in France
is known only in the towns. At the beginning of the
eighteenth century—say one hundred and fifty years
ago (1732)—under Louis XV. the population of France
was estimated at twenty millions of people.<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c016'><sup>[337]</sup></a> There
is good reason to believe that the habits of the people
were entirely different from what they are now; they
were even said to be famous for their large families.<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c016'><sup>[338]</sup></a>
In 1776 their numbers were about twenty-four millions,<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c016'><sup>[339]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>at the Revolution of 1789 about twenty-six
millions,<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c016'><sup>[340]</sup></a> in 1831 thirty-two and a half, and in 1866
thirty-eight. At the present time, from loss of territory
and from decrease of numbers in certain parts
of the country, they are little more than thirty-seven
and a half millions—not much more than the population
of Great Britain, a country neither so large nor
so fertile. Even in 1815 Malthus spoke of France
as having a more stationary and less crowded population
than Britain, though it was richer in corn.<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c016'><sup>[341]</sup></a>
The population of 1881 showed an increase of 766,260
over that of 1876, and was in all 37,672,048.<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c016'><sup>[342]</sup></a> It
increases not by augmentation in the number of
births, for that has been actually lessening, but by
diminution in the deaths. The population of Britain
has trebled itself within the present century; that of
France has not even doubled itself in a century and a
half, with every allowance for a varying frontier. The
fears which Malthus expressed,<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c016'><sup>[343]</sup></a> that the law of inheritance
and compulsory division of property would lead
to an excessive and impoverished country population,
have not been realized. The industrial progress of
the country has been very great. Fifty years ago the
production of wheat was only the half of what it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>to-day, of meat less than the half. In almost every
crop and every kind of food France is richer now
than then in the proportion of more than 2 to 1.
In all the conveniences of life (if food be the necessaries)
the increased supply is as 4 to 1, while foreign
trade has become as 6 to 1. Since property is more
widely distributed in France than elsewhere, an
increase of production is much more certain to mean
a benefit to the whole people. But there are certain
classes of goods, chiefly necessaries, of which (even
in a land like England, where the great wealth is in
a few hands) it is impossible profitably to extend the
production without <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pari passu</span></i> extending the distribution.
When articles of food are imported in vast
quantities, they cannot, from the nature of things,
go entirely to the rich; the rich can easily eat and
drink beyond the normal value, but not much (without
Gargantua’s mouth) beyond the normal quantity;
and, at least in the case of our own country, very little
is exported again. Generally speaking, it is a true saying
that, the more the food, the more are fed. But
what is true of necessaries in England is true even of
other goods in France.<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c016'><sup>[344]</sup></a> The “average wealth of each
person” is not there, as often elsewhere, a mere arithmetical
entity, but a very near approach to the ordinary
state of the great majority of the people; and
this average wealth is thought by good authorities<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c016'><sup>[345]</sup></a>
to have more than doubled since the beginning of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>century. The population, on the other hand, has
only increased by one-half; and the average duration
of life has lengthened from twenty-eight to thirty-seven
years. In a paper of Chateauneuf’s (1826)
quoted by MacCulloch,<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c016'><sup>[346]</sup></a> it was said that the French
people were improving their condition by diminishing
their marriages. The statistician Levasseur, on the
contrary, with the facts of another half-century before
him, tells us that married people in France are the
<em>majority</em> of the population,<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c016'><sup>[347]</sup></a> the average age of marriage
being twenty-six for the women, and rather more than
thirty for the men. The birth-rate, however, is the
lowest in Europe,<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c016'><sup>[348]</sup></a> being 1 in 37, as opposed to 1 in
27 for England. It is by refusing to fill the cradles
that they leave the graves empty. Yet France is
less healthy than England. Its death-rate in 1882
was 22.2 per thousand, while in England it was 19.6.<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c016'><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There are other features which make the case
unique. There are few foreigners in France; the
numbers of the French people are neither swelled by
immigration nor reduced by emigration. Since the
expulsion of the Huguenots and the colonization of
Canada, few nations have been so rooted in their
own country; even Algerian and Tunisian conquests
are due to no popular passion for colonizing. The
peasant properties have made the people averse to
movement.</p>

<p class='c007'>At present most Frenchmen remain during life in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the same Department in which they were born;<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c016'><sup>[350]</sup></a>
and recent observers tell us<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c016'><sup>[351]</sup></a> that a military career
is becoming distasteful to all classes. Taking the
absence of immigration as balanced by the absence
of emigration, we are brought to the conclusion that
the population of France is stationary by its own
deliberate act.</p>

<p class='c007'>How far this is in accordance with the views of
Malthus it is impossible to say in one word. It is
at least the result of the prudence which he was
always preaching. But his prudence lay in the deferring
of marriage; and this is not the form which
prevails in France. Moreover, he thought with Adam
Smith that the progressive state and not the stationary
was the normal one for humanity; if the whole world
became contented with what it had got, there would,
in his opinion, be no progress, and the resources and
capacities of human beings and of the world would
not be developed. In fact, he retained the aspirations
of the Revolution, which the country-folk in France
seem in danger of losing; he wished men to have
hopes for the future as well as a comfortable life in
the present; he saw no virtue in mere smallness any
more than in mere bigness of numbers; he desired as
great as possible a population of stalwart, well-instructed,
wise, and enterprising men; he thought
that, without competition, ambition, and emulation,
and without the element of difficulty and hardship,
human beings would never fully exert their best
powers, though he also thought that a time might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>come when the lower classes would be as the middle
classes, or, in his own words, when the lower would
be diminished and the middle increased, and when,
mainly through the action of the labourers themselves,
inventions would become a real benefit, because
accompanied by lighter labour and shorter hours for
the labourers.<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c016'><sup>[352]</sup></a> As for that love of humanity, that
was so much present in the words and thoughts if
not in the deeds of the men of the Revolution, he had
a full share of it. He desired a longer life for the
living, and fewer births for the sake of fewer deaths.
His work was like that of the lighthouse, to give
light and to save life.</p>

<p class='c006'>In dealing with the question of population in his
own country,<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c016'><sup>[353]</sup></a> Malthus tries to answer at least three
distinct questions:—What were the checks actually
at work in those days? Had the numbers of the
people increased, or not, in the eighteenth century?
What conclusions on either point may be drawn from
the English census?</p>

<p class='c007'>The first question was answered with comparative
fulness in the essay of 1798. It is remarked there
that in England the middle and upper classes increase
at a slow rate, because they are always anxious to
keep their station, and afraid of the expense of
marriage.<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c016'><sup>[354]</sup></a> No man, as a rule, would like his wife’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>social condition to be out of keeping with her habits
and inclinations. Two or three steps of descent will
be considered by most people as a real evil. “If
society be held desirable, it surely must be free,
equal, and reciprocal society, where benefits are conferred
as well as received, and not such as the
dependant finds with his patron or the poor with
the rich.” So it happens that many men, of liberal
education and limited income, do not give effect to
an early attachment by an early marriage. When
their passion is too strong or their judgment too
weak for this restraint, no doubt they have blessings
that counterbalance the obvious evils; “but I fear
it must be owned that the more general consequences
of such marriages are rather calculated to justify
than to repress the forebodings of the prudent.”<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c016'><sup>[355]</sup></a>
What Malthus desires, as we infer from the general
tenor of his book, is that all classes without exception
should show reluctance to impair their standard of
living; and his hatred of the Poor Laws is due to
his conviction that they hinder this end. The subject
will be more fully discussed by-and-by.<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c016'><sup>[356]</sup></a> In the
chapters on England it is little more than mentioned,
the author devoting himself chiefly to the statistical
data of the census and registers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection it was impossible for him to
avoid the question that had long agitated the minds
of politicians. Had the numbers of the English
people been decreasing or increasing since the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Revolution of 1688, and especially in the course of
the eighteenth century? Economists of the present
day are overloaded with statistics; but, when Adam
Smith wrote the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, he was unaware
of the numbers of his own nation. To estimate
population without a census is to study language
without a dictionary; there had been no census since
the coming of the Armada,<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c016'><sup>[357]</sup></a> and it was not till one
hundred years after that event that statistical studies
came much into favour. An annual enumeration of
the people was proposed in the House of Commons in
1753, as a means of knowing the numbers of our
poor.<a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c016'><sup>[358]</sup></a> But the proposal was resisted as anti-Scriptural
and un-English, exposing our weakness to the
foreigner and spending public money to settle the
wagers of the learned. There was probably a fear<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c016'><sup>[359]</sup></a>
that the tax-gatherer would follow on the heels of the
enumerator, as he had done in France. The House
of Lords beat off the bill, and left England in
darkness about the numbers of its people for another
half-century, though something like a census of
Scotland was made for Government in 1755.<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c016'><sup>[360]</sup></a> As
without the Irish Famine we might not have had
the total Repeal of the Corn Laws, so without the
worst of all possible harvests in 1799 we might
have had no census in 1801, for Parliament, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>they passed Mr. Abbot’s Enumeration Bill in 1800,
looked to an enumeration of the people to guide
them in opening and closing the ports to foreign
grain. The practical question about the increase or
decline of English numbers was connected, in logic
as well as in time, with the controversy about the
comparative populousness of ancient and modern
nations. The same year (1753) which saw the
attempt to settle by census the question of England’s
depopulation, saw also the publication of Dr. Robert
Wallace’s reply to Hume’s <cite>Essay on the Populousness
of Ancient Nations</cite>, in his <cite>Dissertations on the Numbers
of Mankind in Ancient and Modern Times</cite>. One of
Henry Fox’s objections to Hardwicke’s Marriage Act
(of 1753) was that it would check population.<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c016'><sup>[361]</sup></a> We
are told<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c016'><sup>[362]</sup></a> that the academical discussion roused
attention on the Continent, and a French savant,
Deslandes, published an estimate of the numbers of
modern nations, in which England was made much
inferior to France, having only eight millions against
twenty. This was too much for English patriotism.
Even in our own day a great war and a few reverses
usually fill England for a year or two with forebodings
of decay. Written in 1757 (at the beginning of the
Seven Years’ War), Dr. John Brown’s <cite>Estimate of the
Manners and Principles of the Times</cite> was only the
most popular of a host of gloomy pamphlets too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>prejudiced to be of much use for statistics.<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c016'><sup>[363]</sup></a> Dr.
Adam Anderson<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c016'><sup>[364]</sup></a> sides with the moderns and the
optimists. The contributions of Dr. Brackenridge
and Richard Forster to the discussion survive by
the mention of them in Price’s <cite>Observations</cite> (pp.
182–3) and in George Chalmers’ <cite>Estimate</cite> (ch. xi. 193),
this last giving on the whole perhaps the most lucid
history of the whole depopulation controversy. We
know from Goldsmith’s <cite>Traveller</cite> (1764) and <cite>Deserted
Village</cite> (1770), with its charming illogical preface,
that even in peace the subject was not out of men’s
thoughts. A similar panic in Switzerland, which
owed its beginning to England,<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c016'><sup>[365]</sup></a> seems afterwards to
have reacted on England itself. The American War
of Independence revived the languishing interest in
the controversy. This time it was the English and
not the antiquarian topic that fell into powerful
hands. Dr. Richard Price, the Radical dissenter, the
friend of Dr. Franklin, and the inventor of Pitt’s
Sinking Fund, did battle, in his <cite>Observations on
Reversionary Payments</cite> (1769), on behalf of the
pessimistic view; Arthur Young, the agriculturist,
the traveller and the talker, led the opposition to
him,<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c016'><sup>[366]</sup></a> and was supported by Sir Frederick Eden,
William Wales, John Howlett, and last but not least
by George Chalmers.<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c016'><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Gregory King<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c016'><sup>[368]</sup></a> and Justice Hale<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c016'><sup>[369]</sup></a> in the seventeenth
century, Dr. Campbell<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c016'><sup>[370]</sup></a> in the eighteenth, had
agreed that the numbers of Norman England must
needs have been small, for the government was bad;
Dr. Price, on the contrary, had maintained the paradox
that, though the Revolution of 1688 brought a “happier
government,” the numbers of the people had
ever since declined.<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c016'><sup>[371]</sup></a> He reasoned from the decreased
number of dwelling-houses assessed to window tax
and house duty, as compared with those assessed to
hearth (or chimney) money before the Revolution.<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c016'><sup>[372]</sup></a>
Opponents denied the accuracy of his data, and
thought his estimate of four and a half or five inhabitants
to a house too low. He pointed to the evil
influence of a “devouring metropolis,” a head too
large for the body, and of great cities that were the
“graves of mankind.”<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c016'><sup>[373]</sup></a> Here, too, both the data and
the inference were doubtful. He argued from the
decreasing produce of the Excise duties. Opponents
answered that, even if the figures were right, a
changed public taste had lessened the consumption
of many taxable articles, and many taxed ones were
supplied free by smuggling.<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c016'><sup>[374]</sup></a> He laid stress on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>difficulty the Government found in raising troops in
the middle of the eighteenth century as compared
with the end of the seventeenth, though he took this
as a symptom, not a cause, and complained at the
same time quite consistently that the increase of the
army and navy and of military expenditure in three
great wars had been a potent cause of diminished
population. Opponents answered that the first was
really a symptom not of decline but of prosperity;
the abundance of other employments kept men from
the need of enlisting in the army; and they answered
too often, that the second (the war expenditure) was
good for trade. They were safer in urging that for
the first part of the century the long peace (1727–40)
and the good harvests (1731–50) made the presumption
of increase very strong.<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c016'><sup>[375]</sup></a> Price made much of
the emigrations to America and to the East and West
Indies. It was answered that the known possibility
of emigration would give men at home the greater
courage to have a family. Even the engrossing and
consolidation of farms and the enclosure of commons,
which he considered to be against population, would,
said his opponents, increase the food, and therefore
the people, though perhaps not the people on the
spot;<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c016'><sup>[376]</sup></a> and the increase of paupers was thought to be
a sign of overflowing numbers. He saw a cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>depopulation in the increased luxury and extravagance
of the people of England. At the beginning of the
century gin-drinking was credited with an evil effect
on population.<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c016'><sup>[377]</sup></a> When the opponents of Price did not
meet this with Mandeville’s sophism, luxury benefits
trade, they answered that what had become greater
was not the national vices but the national standard
of comfort, the expansion of which implied an increase
of general wealth and presumably of population.<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c016'><sup>[378]</sup></a>
Beyond doubt too (it was argued) the general
health was better, and medical science had won some
triumphs.<a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c016'><sup>[379]</sup></a> Malthus, however, warns us against this
argument; great unhealthiness is no proof of a small
population nor healthiness of a large.<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c016'><sup>[380]</sup></a> In the ten
years after the American War of Independence
(1783–93) the prosperity of the country seems to
have advanced by leaps and bounds, only to make
the subsequent depression the more observable. Dr.
Price, who did not live to see the relapse, seems to
have confessed his error. “In allusion to a diminishing
population, on which subject it appears that
he has so widely erred, he says very candidly that
perhaps he may have been insensibly influenced to
maintain an opinion once advanced.”<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c016'><sup>[381]</sup></a> Yet public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>opinion was not fully convinced till 1801, when
“the answers to the Population Act at length happily
rescued the question of the population of this country
from the obscurity in which it had been so long
involved.”<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c016'><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is no good reason to believe that at the end
of last century the fear of depopulation had given
place to a fear of over-population.<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c016'><sup>[383]</sup></a> Malthus and
Arthur Young stood almost alone in their opinion.<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c016'><sup>[384]</sup></a>
Alarm was felt by the agricultural interest, not lest
there should be an excessive population, but lest the
population should get its food from abroad. The
population it was feared had grown beyond the
English supplies of food; but of over-population, in
the wider sense of an excess beyond any existing food,
the general public and the squires had learned little
or nothing in these years; and we have no reason to
attribute to Malthus any share in the merit of passing
the Enumeration Bill. It was brought forward in an
autumn session of Parliament (Nov. 1800) specially
convened because of the scarcity. It was moved
by Mr. Abbot,<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c016'><sup>[385]</sup></a> who had made his name more as
a financier than as an economist, and was chiefly
remarkable afterwards as a vigorous opponent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Catholic Emancipation. The motion was seconded
by Mr. Wilberforce; and the combination of finance
and philanthropy was irresistible. Malthus, though
he is the true interpreter of the census, neither caused
it in the first instance nor found it of immediate
service in spreading his doctrines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first census would hardly have justified him
in treating as obsolete the old quarrel about depopulation;
it had decided only the absolute numbers
in the first year of the nineteenth century, not the
progress or relapse during the eighteenth. Besides
giving the actual numbers of the people in 1801,
the census no doubt gave “a table of the population
of England and Wales throughout the last century
calculated from the births.” But the births, though
a favourite, were an unsafe criterion; and, for the
population at the Revolution of 1688, Malthus would
depend more on “the old calculations from the number
of houses.”<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c016'><sup>[386]</sup></a> He finds no difficulty of principle in
admitting with Mr. Rickman, the editor of the census
returns and observations thereon, that the rapid increase
of the English people since 1780 was due to
the decrease of deaths rather than to the increase of
births.<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c016'><sup>[387]</sup></a> Such a phenomenon was not only possible
but common, for the rate of births out of relation to
the rate of deaths could give no sure means of
judging the numbers. After a famine<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c016'><sup>[388]</sup></a> or pestilence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>for example, the rate of births might be twice as high
as usual, and by the standard of births the numbers
of the people would be at their maximum, when a
comparison with the rate of deaths or an actual
enumeration would show them to be at the minimum,<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c016'><sup>[389]</sup></a>
whereas a low rate of births, if lives were
prolonged by great healthiness, might certainly mean
an increase, perhaps a high increase, of numbers.
But at the particular time in question the factory
system was coming into being, and manufacturing
towns were growing great at the expense of the
country districts. The conditions of life in towns are
at the best inferior to those in the country; new
openings for trade would add not only to the marriages
but to the deaths and the births.<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c016'><sup>[390]</sup></a> The presumption
was not all in favour of healthiness; and the
registers at that particular time could not tell the
whole truth;—the drain of recruits for foreign service
would keep down the lists of burials at home, while
allowing an increase of births and marriages.<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c016'><sup>[391]</sup></a> For
these and other reasons, Malthus, while he agrees
with Rickman that the general health has improved,
trusts little to his calculations from registers; and
concludes that even the census gives us no clear
light on the movement of population in the eighteenth
century. We can be certain that population
increased during the last twenty years of it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>almost certain that the movement was not downwards
but upwards since the Peace of Paris; and we
have good ground for believing that it was rather
upwards than downwards even in the earliest years
of the century, during the good harvests and the long
peace of Walpole,<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c016'><sup>[392]</sup></a> and that over the whole country
the movement of population was less fluctuating in
England than on the Continent.<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c016'><sup>[393]</sup></a> The author’s admission,
that the proportions of the births, deaths, and
marriages were very different in our country in his
time from what they used to be,<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c016'><sup>[394]</sup></a> seems to put the
census of 1801 out of court altogether in the question
of depopulation, especially as there were no previous
enumerations with which to compare it. The figures
from the parish registers for the whole of the century,
that were included in the “returns pursuant to
the Population Act,” in addition to the enumeration,
turned out on examination to be unsatisfactory.<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c016'><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus, however, was able to prove some solid
conclusions from the census of 1801. It had shown,
for example, as regards marriages, that the proportion
of them to the whole numbers of the people was, in
1801, as 1 to 123⅕, a smaller proportion than anywhere
except in Norway and Switzerland,<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c016'><sup>[396]</sup></a> and the
more likely to be true, because Hardwicke’s Marriage
Act had made registration of marriages more careful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>than of burials and baptisms. In the early part of
the eighteenth century, the pessimist, Dr. Short, had
estimated the proportion (with much probability) as
1 to 115; and it would appear, therefore, that at
neither end of the century were the marriages in a
high proportion to the numbers, or had population
increased at its highest rate. Again, Malthus thinks
it proved by the census that, since population has
as a matter of fact increased in England in spite of a
diminished rate of marriages, the increase has been
at cost of the mortality, the fewer marriages being
partly a cause, partly a consequence, of the fewer
deaths of the later years.<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c016'><sup>[397]</sup></a> Those that married late
might have consoled themselves with the reflection
that they were lessening not the numbers but the
mortality of the nation. It was no doubt difficult to
estimate the extent to which such causes operated,
or the degree in which the national health had been
improved. In any case the census guides us better
than the registers,<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c016'><sup>[398]</sup></a> for it carries us beyond the
inferred numbers to numbers actually counted out
at a given time. Neither the census nor the registers
can be rightly interpreted without a knowledge of
the social condition, government, and history of the
people concerned. In undeveloped countries, like
America and Russia, or in any old countries after
special mortality, a large proportion of births may be
a good sign; “but in the average state of a well-peopled
territory there cannot well be a worse sign
than a large proportion of births, nor can there well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>be a better sign than a small proportion.” Sir
Francis d’Ivernois had very justly observed that, if
the various states of Europe published annually an
exact account of their population, noting carefully in
a second column the exact age at which the children
die, this second column would show the comparative
goodness of the governments, and the comparative
happiness of their subjects;—a simple arithmetical
statement might then be more conclusive than the
cleverest argument. Malthus assents, but adds that
“we should need to attend less to the column giving
the number of children born, than to the one giving
the number which reached manhood, and this number
will almost invariably be the greatest where the proportion
of the births to the whole population is the
least.”<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c016'><sup>[399]</sup></a> Tried by this standard, which is much more
truly the central doctrine of Malthus than the ratios,
our own country was even then better than all, save
two, European countries. Tried by it to-day, we
have still a good place. Though no great European
countries, except Austro-Hungary and Germany, have
had more <em>marriages</em>, in the twenty years from 1861
to 1880, not only these, but Holland, Spain, and
Italy, have had more <em>births</em>, and all of them except
Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have had more <em>deaths</em>,
in proportion to their numbers.<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c016'><sup>[400]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One great advantage of the census is, that it enables
the registrars to calculate from their own data, with
certain sure limits of told-out numbers behind and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>before them. “When the registers contain all the
births and deaths, and there are the means [given by
the census] of setting out from a known population,
it is obviously the same as an actual enumeration.”<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c016'><sup>[401]</sup></a>
Malthus suggested in 1803 that the experiment of
1801 should be repeated every ten years, and that
registrars’ reports should be made every year.<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c016'><sup>[402]</sup></a> This
has been done; and, if both have been accurate, then
the registers of the intervening years, on the basis of
the decennial enumeration, ought to make us able
to calculate the numbers for any intervening year.
Accordingly, the population of England in 1881, as
calculated from the births and deaths, was little more
than one-sixth of a million different from the numbers
as actually counted over on the night of the 4th of
April in that year.<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c016'><sup>[403]</sup></a> The growth in the last decade,
1871 to 1881, was higher than in any since 1831–41;<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c016'><sup>[404]</sup></a>
the births were more and the deaths fewer than
usual. Another London has been added to our
numbers in ten years.<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c016'><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This gives no sure ground, however, for prediction.
To suppose a country’s rate of increase permanent
is hardly less fallacious than to suppose an invariable
order of births and deaths over the world generally.
Even if we are beyond the time when we need to
make any allowance for increasing accuracy and fulness,
and if we may assume that no given census has any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>units to sweep into its net that through their fear or
an official’s carelessness escaped its predecessor, still
we cannot take the rate of increase from one census
to another as a sure indication of the future. With
some qualifications the words of Malthus apply to us
in 1881 quite as accurately as to our fathers in 1811:
“This is a rate of increase which in the nature of
things cannot be permanent. It has been occasioned
by the stimulus of a greatly increased demand for
labour, combined with a greatly increased power of
production, both in agriculture and manufactures.
These are the two elements which form the most
effective encouragement to a rapid increase of population.
What has taken place is a striking illustration
of the principle of population, and a proof that, in
spite of great towns, manufacturing occupations, and
the gradually acquired habits of an opulent and
luxuriant people, if the resources of a country will
admit of a rapid increase, and if these resources
are so advantageously distributed as to occasion a
constantly increasing demand for labour, the population
will not fail to keep pace with them.”<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c016'><sup>[406]</sup></a> It was
a rate of increase which he saw would double the
population in less than fifty-five years; and this
doubling has really happened. The numbers for
England in 1801 were 8,892,536; and in 1851 they
were 17,927,609. Malthus had not anticipated any
greater changes in manufacture and trade than those
of his own day; and he clearly expected that the
rate of increase would not continue and the numbers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>would not be doubled. The one thing certain was the
impossibility of safe prediction on the strength of
any existing rate. A writer at the beginning of this
century prophesied the extinction of the Turkish
people in one hundred years; Sir William Petty at
the end of the seventeenth century predicted that in
1800 London would have 5,359,000 inhabitants. But
the Turks are not yet extinct; London in 1800 had
less than a million of people, and has taken eighty years
more to raise them to the number in the prophecy.<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c016'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If prediction was difficult in the case of England,
it was not less so in the case of the other parts of
the United Kingdom. The conditions of society and
industry were quite different in the three countries;
and to judge of the actual or probable growth of
population in Scotland or Ireland, we must first, as
with England, clearly understand these conditions.
In the early part of this century even more than
now, Scotland<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c016'><sup>[408]</sup></a> stood to England as the country
districts of England now stand to its great towns.
Continual migration from country to town may be
said to have been its normal state; and the largest
towns were in England. The change from a militant
and feudal to an industrial society was nowhere so
marked as in Scotland after the Union, and especially
after the rebellion of 1745. The hereditary judgeships
of highland chiefs were swept away; the relation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>between chief and clansmen became the unromantic
relation of landlord and tenant. The displacement
of household work by the factory system, and of hand
labour by machinery, crowded the great towns of
Scotland at the expense of the country districts; and
crowded the great towns and manufacturing districts
of England at the expense of Scotland. The flood
of North Britons into England was not of Bute’s
making; and it was greatest after and not before the
Peace of Paris, although under that peace and a
stable government the farming, the manufacturing,
the banking, and the foreign trading of Scotland itself
had grown great enough (it might have seemed)
to employ the whole population at home. Cotton
manufacture, which on the whole is the typical
industry of these latter days, was peculiarly English.<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c016'><sup>[409]</sup></a>
Sheep-farming at home and cotton-spinning in
England combined to depopulate the Scotch highlands
and much of the lowlands. The highlands,
with their strongly-marked physical features and
strictly limited industrial possibilities, were somewhat
in the position of Norway. In the highlands
proper there were no mineral riches; there were moorlands,
mountains, streams, lochs, heather, bracken,
peat, and bog; the patches of cultivable soil would
bear a scanty crop of oats, and perhaps clover, barley,
or potatoes.<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c016'><sup>[410]</sup></a> This description applied to a large half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>of entire Scotland; and we must bear it in mind to
understand the saying of Malthus in 1803: “Scotland
is certainly over-peopled, but not so much as it was a
century or half a century ago, when it contained fewer
inhabitants.”<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c016'><sup>[411]</sup></a> The highlands are over their whole
extent what the lowlands are as regards their hills, fit
only for sheep. Sutherland has about thirteen inhabitants
to the square mile now, and Midlothian
seven hundred and forty-six; but Sutherland and not
Midlothian may be over-peopled. Sutherland as compared
with her former self, when she had thirty or forty
to the square mile, may be more or she may be less
over-peopled than she once was; we cannot tell till we
know what her wealth was and how it was distributed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the patriarchal government<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c016'><sup>[412]</sup></a> of early times
the wealth of the country consisted literally in its men.
If a chief were asked the rent of his estate, he would
answer that it raised five hundred men; the tenant
paid him in military service. Adam Smith remembers
that in the Jacobite Rebellion, which disturbed his
country at the time he was studying at Oxford, “Mr.
Cameron of Lochiel, a gentleman of Lochaber in [the
west highlands of] Scotland, whose rent never exceeded
£500 [English] a year, carried, in 1745, eight hundred
of his own people into the rebellion with him.”<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c016'><sup>[413]</sup></a>
Subdivision of land meant more retainers and greater
honour; and so the highlands were peopled not to
the full extent of the work to be done, but actually to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the full extent of the bare food got from the soil.<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c016'><sup>[414]</sup></a>
On the establishment of a strong government and
the abolition of their hereditary judicial privileges,<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c016'><sup>[415]</sup></a>
the chiefs soon became willing to convert the value
in men into a value in money, exchanging dignity for
profit. They no longer encouraged their tenants to
have large families; and yet they made no efforts to
remove the habits, which the tenants had formed, of
having them.<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c016'><sup>[416]</sup></a> It was this change that gave Sir
Walter Scott the materials for his most powerful
pictures in <cite>Waverley</cite> and other novels. But it is the
distress of the chiefs that is tragic to him, rather than
the misery of the clansmen. The clansmen for their
part had under feudalism been brought up to be
farmers or cattle-dealers and nothing else; there was
as little variety of occupation in the highlands then
as in Ireland now. Undoubtedly too they had that
customary right of long possession, which law so often
construed into a legal title in the case of more
influential men. It was true also that, if the native
highlanders would not cultivate that poor soil, no
strangers would, and, if it was politically desirable
that the country should remain peopled, the
only way to secure this was to prevent the native
exodus.<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c016'><sup>[417]</sup></a> No such attempt was made; but, on the
contrary, the highland landlords followed the way
that led to the highest rents; they consolidated their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>farms; they exchanged agriculture for pasture; they
substituted deer for sheep. Almost every highland
district has sooner or later passed through all these
three stages, and with the same result, the employment
of fewer and fewer men.<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c016'><sup>[418]</sup></a> The discarded
men had two courses before them, migration to the
lowlands<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c016'><sup>[419]</sup></a> or emigration to the colonies. The farm
labourer would migrate, the farmer emigrate. The
landlords incurred and often deserved odium for the
manner of their evictions; but they treated the
evicted better than the average British capitalist
treats his dismissed hands. They usually provided
passages and often procured settlements abroad for
them. Lord Selkirk, one of the few writers on this
subject that preserves a judicial calmness, advised his
countrymen to acquiesce in the “depopulation” of the
highlands, but to draw the stream of emigration to
our own colonies. He himself drew it, so far as
he could, to the Red River settlement and Prince
Edward Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the middle of last century to the beginning
of this, emigration went on except when war made
it impossible. The dangerous qualities of the highlanders
made them very valuable in the three great
wars that prevented them from leaving the country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>with their families. It may be that this very military
consideration induced the English Government to
connive at the clearances at first; and interference
at any later stage was very difficult. As it is, in
the end even the Sutherland evictions<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c016'><sup>[420]</sup></a> seem simply
to have shifted the population and not removed it.
In spite of emigration Sutherland had as many inhabitants
at the last census of 1881, as at the first
in 1801, namely, above 23,000. Fishing, an industry
new to a great part of the highlands, made this
phenomenon possible. Fishing villages have grown
at the expense of inland farms. But this is not the
whole truth. Till the time when free trade began
to distend Glasgow and other great towns of Scotland,
the highland counties taken altogether had
actually increased in population, as compared with
what they were in 1801. The subsequent fall is
due not to any great clearances or emigrations, but
to another cause that had been acting though not
conspicuously for some time before. This was migration
to the industrial centres of the lowlands. In
the days of the Tudors there were complaints in
England of the decay of towns, because a strong
government had at last made the protection of walled
towns superfluous, and industry had spread itself in
peace, where it was wanted. But two centuries later
there was decay not of the towns but of the country
districts, because industry was taking forms that
made concentration necessary. At first, both in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>England and Scotland, there was a real diminution
in the rural population; there had been for the time
a real diminution of the work to be done in the
country, and a transference of it to the towns. The
hand-loom weaver had been supplanted by the power-loom.
The little villages, where the workman lived
idyllically, half in his farm and half in his workshop,
now either sent their whole families to the towns,
thus stopping their contributions to the parish registers
in the country and swelling those of the town,
or, still keeping the parents, sent three-fourths of
the children there, thus making the country registers
a very untrustworthy reflection of the real state of
the population in the country districts. That country
villages in every part of Scotland, but especially near
the large cities, are “breeding grounds” of this latter
description<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c016'><sup>[421]</sup></a> is perfectly well known; and the same is
true, in a less degree, of England. This is one reason
why even the purely rural districts of Scotland have
greatly increased in apparent population since 1801,
and most of them are increasing still; the readiness
of the Scotch to emigrate has caused the large
families quite as much as the large families the
emigration. Another reason is, that even in the
country districts there is now more work to be done
and it is done better. Orthodox economists may
count this an example of the self-healing effects of
an economical change that causes much suffering at
first. It is fair to say that this eventual cure is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>neither more nor less complete than the cure of the
analogous hardships of the newly-introduced factory system,
and the temporary inconveniences of sudden
free trade. What keen commercial ambition can do
it has done, and its success is at least sufficiently
complete to justify us in saying of Scotland to-day
what Malthus said of it eighty years ago: it was
most over-populated when it had fewest inhabitants.
Modern improvements, however short of perfection,
have at least both in England and in Scotland absolutely
put an end to periodical famines. Even the
scarcities of 1799 and 1800, though they caused great
distress in both countries, were not famines in either of
them; and, since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846,
even such general distress as was caused in Scotland
by the potato blight cannot occur again. That distress
itself was as nothing compared with the terrible
dearths from which Scotland used to suffer five or six
times a century, and which England experienced as
late as the seventeenth.<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c016'><sup>[422]</sup></a> The dismal picture<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c016'><sup>[423]</sup></a> which
Malthus draws of the condition of the Scottish
peasantry reminds us that it is not much more than
a century since Scotland took her first steps in
civilization and turned her energies from war to
commerce. Her population at the ’45 was about
one and a quarter millions, in 1801 about one
and a half; but in 1861 more than three, and in
1881 three and three-quarters. Population therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>has more than doubled within the century. But
even now there are only a hundred and twenty-one
inhabitants to the square mile, as compared with four
hundred and forty-five in England. The wealth of
the country has increased immensely faster than the
population; it has multiplied fivefold since the middle
of this century, and tenfold since the beginning of it.<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c016'><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The history of population in Ireland would have furnished
Malthus with still more striking illustrations of
his principles, if his life had lasted a few years longer.
He contents himself (till the 6th edition of the <cite>Essay</cite><a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c016'><sup>[425]</sup></a>)
with a single paragraph: “The details of the population
of Ireland are but little known. I shall only
observe, therefore, that the extended use of potatoes
has allowed of a very rapid increase of it during the
last century. But the cheapness of this nourishing
root, and the small piece of ground which, under this
kind of cultivation, will in average years produce
the food for a family, joined to the ignorance and
depressed state<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c016'><sup>[426]</sup></a> of the people, which have prompted
them to follow their inclinations with no other
prospect than an immediate bare subsistence, have
encouraged marriage to such a degree, that the
population is pushed much beyond the industry and
present resources of the country; and the consequence
naturally is, that the lower classes of people are in
the most impoverished<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c016'><sup>[427]</sup></a> and miserable state. The
checks to the population are of course chiefly of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>positive kind, and arise from the diseases occasioned
by squalid poverty, by damp and wretched cabins,
by bad and insufficient clothing,<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c016'><sup>[428]</sup></a> and occasional
want. To these positive checks have of late years
been added the vice and misery of intestine commotion,
of civil war, and of martial law.”<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c016'><sup>[429]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In his review of Newenham’s <cite>Statistical and Historical
Enquiry into the Population of Ireland</cite> in 1808,<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c016'><sup>[430]</sup></a>
and in his evidence before the Emigration Committee
in 1827, Malthus uses even stronger language. We
may quote from the latter document as the less known
of the two. In 1817 he had spent a college vacation
in visiting Westmeath and the lakes of Killarney,<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c016'><sup>[431]</sup></a>
and was able to speak from personal knowledge of the
country. He was asked:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Qu. 3306. “With reference to Ireland, what is
your opinion as to the habits of the people, as tending
to promote a rapid increase of population?”—“Their
habits are very unfavourable in regard to their own
condition, because they are inclined to be satisfied
with the very lowest degree of comfort, and to marry
with little other prospect than that of being able to
get potatoes for themselves and their children.”<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c016'><sup>[432]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>3307. “What are the circumstances which contribute
to introduce such habits in a country?”—“The
degraded condition of the people, oppression,
and ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3311. “You have mentioned that oppression contributes
to produce those habits to which you have
alluded; in what way do you imagine in Ireland there
is oppression?”—“I think that the government of
Ireland has, upon the whole, been very unfavourable
to habits of that kind; it has tended to degrade the
general mass of the people, and consequently to
prevent them from looking forward and acquiring
habits of prudence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3312. “Is it your opinion that the minds of the
people may be so influenced by the circumstances
under which they live, in regard to civil society,
that it may contribute very much to counteract that
particular habit which leads to the rapid increase of
population?”—“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3313. “What circumstances in your opinion contribute
to produce a taste for comfort and cleanliness
among a people?”—“Civil and political liberty and
education.”<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c016'><sup>[433]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Then the subject of one acre holdings is introduced,
and Malthus is asked:—</p>

<p class='c007'>3317. “What effect would any change of the
moral or religious state of the government of that
country produce upon persons occupying such possessions?”—“It
could not produce any immediate effect
if that system were continued; with that system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>occupancy there must always be an excessive redundancy
of people, because, from the nature of tolerably
good land, it will always produce more than can
be employed upon it, and the consequence must be
that there will be a great number of people not
employed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3318. “Is, therefore, not the first step towards improvement
in Ireland necessarily to be accomplished by
an alteration of the present state of the occupancy of
the land?” This was a leading question, but Malthus
would not be led. He replied, “I think that such
an alteration is of the greatest possible importance,
but that the other (the change in the government)
should accompany it; it would not have the same
force without.” In his answers to later questions he
gave his view at greater length on the causes of the
difference between English and Irish character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Answ. to qu. 3411. “At the time of the introduction
of the potato into Ireland the Irish people
were in a very low and degraded state, and the
increased quantity of food was only applied to increase
the population. But when our [English] wages
of labour in wheat were high in the early part of
the last century, it did not appear that they were
employed merely in the maintenance of more families,
but in improving the condition of the people in their
general mode of living.”<a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c016'><sup>[434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>3413. “You attribute the difference of the character
of the people to the difference of food?”—“In a great
measure.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>3414. “What circumstance determines the difference
of food in the two countries?”—“The circumstances
are partly physical and partly moral.<a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c016'><sup>[435]</sup></a> It will
depend in a certain degree upon the soil and climate
whether the people live on maize, wheat, oats, potatoes,
or meat.”<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c016'><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>3415. “Is not the selection in some degree dependent
on the general state of society?”—“Very
much on moral causes, on their being in so respectable
a situation that they are in the habit of looking
forward, and exercising a certain degree of prudence;
and there is no doubt that in different countries
this kind of prudence is exercised in very different
degrees.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3416. “Does it depend at all on the government
under which they live?”—“Very much on the
government, on the strict and equal administration of
justice, on the perfect security of property, on civil,
religious, and political liberty; for people respect themselves
more under favourable circumstances of this
kind, and are less inclined to marry, with[out] the prospect
of more physical sustenance for their children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3417. “On the degree of respect with which they
are treated by their superiors?”—“Yes; one of the
greatest faults in Ireland is that the labouring classes
there are not treated with proper respect by their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>superiors; they are treated as if they were a degraded
people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thereupon he is again asked a leading question of
a somewhat cynical character, but he is again cautious
in his answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>3418. “Does not that treatment mainly arise
from their existing in such redundancy as to be no
object to their superiors?”—“In part it does perhaps;
but it appeared to take place before that [redundancy]
was the case, to the same degree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The questioner, however, begs the question and
asks:</p>

<p class='c007'>3419. “The number being the cause of their treatment,
will not their treatment tend to the increase
of that number?” and the answer is: “Yes, they
act and react on each other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly his opinion in 1827 is, as it was in
1803, that emigration conjoined with other agencies
will be good for Ireland, but by itself will leave
matters no better than they were.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alongside of his weighty words in the essay
and in the evidence it is worth while to place
the words written by Adam Smith half a century
earlier:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the union with England, the middling and
inferior ranks of people in Scotland gained a complete
deliverance from the power of an aristocracy which
had always before oppressed them. By a union with
Great Britain, the greater part of the people of all
ranks in Ireland would gain an equally complete
deliverance from a much more oppressive aristocracy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>an aristocracy not founded, like that of Scotland, in
the natural and respectable distinctions of birth and
fortune, but in the most odious of all distinctions,
those of religious and political prejudices; distinctions
which, more than any other, animate both the
insolence of the oppressors and the hatred and indignation
of the oppressed, and which commonly render
the inhabitants of the same country more hostile to
one another than those of different countries ever
are.”<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c016'><sup>[437]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>With such passages before us, we cannot consider
the two economists to have been behind their age in
their Irish policy. In regard to accurate figures, the
later economist was little better off than the earlier.
Ireland was not included in the first two censuses of
1801 and 1811. In 1695 its population was estimated
by Captain South as little more than one million;<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c016'><sup>[438]</sup></a>
in 1731, by inquiry of Irish House of Lords, at two
millions; in 1792 by Dr. Beaufort at a little above
four millions;<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c016'><sup>[439]</sup></a> in 1805 by Newenham at five and a
half millions; in 1812 an imperfect census gave it
as nearly six millions; in the census of 1821 it was
6,800,000. It was clear that the population of
Ireland was increasing even then faster than that of
England.<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c016'><sup>[440]</sup></a> But between these dates and our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>times comes an episode striking enough to provide
all economical histories with a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus pannus</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>For about two generations England had perpetrated
in Ireland her crowning feats of commercial jealousy,
a jealousy not more foolish or wicked against Ireland
than it was against the American colonies, or, till
1707, against Scotland, but more easily victorious.
Ireland had not begun to be in any sense an industrial
country till the reigns of Elizabeth and James I.;
and the wars of the succeeding reigns hampered her
early efforts. She had fair corn and meadow lands,
and perhaps the best pastures in the world for sheep
and cattle. The English farming interest became
impatient of Irish competition, and a law was passed
to forbid the importation of Irish sheep and cattle
and dairy produce into England (1665, 1680). By
reason of the later Navigation Acts, Ireland could not
make amends for this by trading with America, for
all such trading must be by way of England and in
English ships, nor by trading with France for the
same reason. England in her jealousy would have
surrounded her with a cordon quite as close as
Berkeley’s wall of brass.<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c016'><sup>[441]</sup></a> As soon as a considerable
woollen manufacture grew up, England stopped it
by legislation, which (in 1699) forbade the exportation
of Irish woollens not only to England but to
any other country whatever. English interference,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>if it had done no more, added immensely to the
uncertainties<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c016'><sup>[442]</sup></a> and fluctuations of Irish trade. The
growth of industries like the woollen manufacture
had set on foot a growth of population which did
not stop with the arrest of the industries. As often
happens,<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c016'><sup>[443]</sup></a> the effects of an impulse to marriage lasted
far beyond the industrial progress that gave the
impulse. But this means hunger and suffering, if
not death. In the case of Ireland, the ruin of all
industries but farming over more than three-fourths
of the land led to an absolute dependence of the
people on the harvest of their own country; and,
where it failed them, they were brought face to face
with dearth or famine. It led also to the peopling
of the country districts at the expense of the towns,<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c016'><sup>[444]</sup></a>
instead of (as usual) the towns at the expense of
the country. If Goldsmith’s <cite>Deserted Village</cite> is not
English, it is not Irish. By the year 1780, when
Lord North from fear of rebellion granted free trade
to Ireland with Great Britain, the mischief had been
made almost incurable. The great increase in the
Irish population, like the great increase in the English,
may be said to begin in a free trade movement. In
the worst days of legal persecution it might have
been said of the Irish Catholic population, the more
they were afflicted the more they multiplied and
grew. Lavergne<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c016'><sup>[445]</sup></a> thinks their greater increase was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>due first to the physiological law, that in the case of
all animals the means of reproduction are multiplied
in proportion to the chances of destruction[?], and
second to the instinctively sound tactics of a people
otherwise defenceless. The probability is, too, that
they remained quiet under their multitudinous industrial,
political, and religious disqualifications so long,
because they were reduced to that depth of misery
that kills the very power of resistance; and poverty
at its extreme point is a positive but not a preventive
check on population. Where things are so bad,
marriage, it is thought, cannot make them worse, and
marriage would go on at the expense of a high
mortality, general pauperism, or continuous emigration.
The pureness of marriage relations in Ireland,
though in itself a much greater good than its consequences
were evil, acted as it would have done in
Godwin’s Utopia;<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c016'><sup>[446]</sup></a> apart from wisdom, virtue itself
had its evils. Potatoes by-and-by came into general
use; and the bad harvests, which taught even the
Scotch and English poor<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c016'><sup>[447]</sup></a> to make frequent use of
this substitute for corn, converted it in Ireland from
a substitute into a staple. Economists viewed this
change with almost unanimous disapproval. In the
view of Malthus it was the cheapness of this food
that made it dangerous for the labourers; his theory
of wages led him to object to cheap corn on the same
grounds.<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c016'><sup>[448]</sup></a> On the principle that it needs difficulties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>to generate energy, the Irish are made indolent by
their cheap food, and make no use of it except to
increase by it. Living on the cheapest food procurable,
they could not in scarcity fall back on anything
else. Every man who wished to marry might obtain
a cabin and potatoes.<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c016'><sup>[449]</sup></a> At the lowest calculation, an
acre of land planted with potatoes will support twice
as much as one of the same quality sown with
wheat.<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c016'><sup>[450]</sup></a> There are other objections to a potato diet.
It is a simple (as opposed to a composite) diet, and
it involves a low standard of comfort. The second
is not the same as the first, for a people that had no
variety in their food might conceivably have a great
variety in their other comforts. As a matter of fact,
however, it was none of these three supposed disadvantages
of the potato that proved the bane of the Irish
population, but a fourth one, its liability to blight.<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c016'><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The figures of the census tell their own tale. In
1821 the Irish people numbered 6,801,827; in 1831,
7,767,401; in 1841, 8,199,853; but in 1851, 6,514,473.
In each previous decade the increase approached a
million; in the last there was not only no increase,
but a decrease of more than a million and a half.
There had been a disastrous famine followed by great
emigrations. What happened on Lord Lansdowne’s
estate in Kerry is an example of what took place
over Ireland generally.<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c016'><sup>[452]</sup></a> That estate comprehended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>about 100,000 acres, on which before the famine there
was a population of 16,000 souls. When the famine
came a fourth part of them perished and another
fourth emigrated. In course of time, thanks to
money sent by relatives from America and advances
made by Lord Lansdowne, the emigration continued
with such rapidity that only 2000 souls were left on
the estate. The famine taught the people how to
emigrate, and gave them some idea of the meaning
of over-population. The rural districts of Ireland
are probably over-peopled now; but there seems
reason to believe that a body of tenants, who are
little short of peasant proprietors in security of
tenure, and who have been forced into a knowledge
of the world outside Ireland, will not retain the
habits of the old occupiers.<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c016'><sup>[453]</sup></a> Without a change of
habits, peasant proprietorships would have done little
for France, and will do little for Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>This would certainly have been the judgment of
Malthus on things as they are now in Ireland,
after Catholic Emancipation, Disestablishment, and
the Land Act. In his own time he was wise enough
to see that the first could not be delayed without
injustice and danger. The rapid increase of the
Catholic population would soon, he foresaw in 1808,<a id='r454'></a><a href='#f454' class='c016'><sup>[454]</sup></a>
bring the question of Emancipation within the range
of “practical politics,” and if the measure had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>passed, as he urged, in 1808, instead of twenty years
later, the labour of conciliating Ireland might have
proved easier, and the political change might have
helped to produce that change in the habits of the
people which Malthus deemed essential to its permanent
prosperity.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <cite>Essay on Population</cite> deals with the past, the
present, and the future. We have tried to follow its
account of past and present, and must now consider
the author’s view of future prospects and of the
various schemes (including his own) for making the
future better than the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>To do justice to this half of the essay, we must
take further liberties with its arrangement. For
the sake of explaining the historical genesis of the
essay, we have already taken first<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c016'><sup>[455]</sup></a> that criticism of
Godwin and Condorcet which in the later essay
comes in the centre of the work,<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c016'><sup>[456]</sup></a> on the heels of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>account of population in the United Kingdom, the
point where we have now arrived; and the chapter
on emigration has been used before its time. There
remain, out of the fourteen chapters of the third book
of the essay, eleven still untouched; and in all but
one<a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c016'><sup>[457]</sup></a> a knowledge of the general economical doctrine
of Malthus is indispensable to a clear and just understanding
of him. No apology is needed then for a
somewhat long digression, in which the chief economical
writings of our author are briefly analyzed. It
is not wholly a digression, as the substance of seven<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c016'><sup>[458]</sup></a>
out of ten chapters will be found incorporated with
it, and their logical connection with the author’s
economical theories (so far as it exists) will be shown.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a thoroughly practical man, Malthus knew that
philanthropy can do little without sound doctrine;
and his economical theories belong to the substance
of his work. They were developed, unlike the <cite>Essay
on Population</cite>, in quiet controversy among friends;
Ricardo, James Mill, and Jean Baptiste Say, who
were critics of the <cite>Political Economy</cite>, had been converts
of the <cite>Essay</cite>. These were, however, the very
men who came nearest to identify orthodox economics
with rigorous abstraction. Malthus himself, labouring
to build up the neglected pathology of economic
science, was not chargeable with this fault. His first
work had happily fixed into an intellectual principle
his natural inclination to look at speculative questions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>in their relations to practice, and to look at “things as
they are”<a id='r459'></a><a href='#f459' class='c016'><sup>[459]</sup></a> rather than as they might be. Ricardo’s
first work, bearing wholly on finance,<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c016'><sup>[460]</sup></a> had unhappily
fixed for him his inclination to treat every social
question as a problem in arithmetic. In both cases
the excitement of controversy would make the impression
deeper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two economists both start from Adam Smith,<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c016'><sup>[461]</sup></a>
as theologians from the Bible. It was becoming clear
that these Scriptures were of doubtful interpretation.
Men were to choose between the Calvinism of Ricardo
and the Arminianism of Malthus; and, when the two
writers turned from their debates with the public to
debates with each other, no less a prize was in question
than the hegemony of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was won by Ricardo, whose <cite>Principles of
Political Economy and Taxation</cite> (1817) were accepted
by James Mill, MacCulloch, Nassau Senior, to say
nothing of others, as the Institutes of their creed.
MacCulloch thought it not worth his while to print
what Ricardo had thought it worth his while to write,
in vindication of his positions against Malthus.<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c016'><sup>[462]</sup></a> The
strongest ally of Malthus was Sismondi. It was not
till Ricardo had reigned for thirty years that there
was serious sign of defection, when the son of James
Mill broke with his father’s traditions;<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c016'><sup>[463]</sup></a> and, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>in the hands of Thornton, Cliffe Leslie, Walker, and
others, the reaction has been carried to the utmost,
the eclipse of Ricardo has done nothing to rescue
Malthus from obscurity. The very success of the
<cite>Essay on Population</cite> may have deepened the oblivion
of the other writings in virtue of the popular fallacy
that a man cannot be equally great in general theory
and in the advocacy of one particular reform.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>Political Economy</cite> of Malthus has its faults;
but it contains in outline the main truths which
writers of our own time think they have established
against Ricardo. First and foremost, he maintains
with them that the proper study of the science is
not Wealth, but Man, or more definitely, Wealth in
relation to Man. The qualities of man and the
earth he cultivates are according to Malthus so many
and variable in relation to each other that a study
of their relations cannot be an exact science like
mathematics; it may contain “great general principles”
to which there are few exceptions, and
“prominent landmarks” that will be safe guides to
us in legislation or in life; but “even these when
examined will be found to resemble the most general
rules in morals and politics founded upon the
known passions and propensities of human nature.”<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c016'><sup>[464]</sup></a>
Human conduct is characterized by such variation
and aberration that we must always be prepared for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>exceptions to our principles, and for qualifications
which spoil the charm of uniformity, but are faithful
to facts,<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c016'><sup>[465]</sup></a> like George Eliot’s “analyses in small and
subtle characters,” which stimulate no enthusiasm but
alone tell the whole truth. In the second place, we
are told that the nature of the subject makes a
peculiarly cautious Method necessary. Our first
business being to account for things as they are,<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c016'><sup>[466]</sup></a>
till we are sure that our theories do so we cannot
act on them.<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c016'><sup>[467]</sup></a> A good economical definition must
conform to the ordinary usage of words. We must
take if possible a meaning which would agree with
the ordinary use of words “in the conversation of
educated persons.”<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c016'><sup>[468]</sup></a> If this does not give sufficient
distinctness, we must fall back on the authority of the
most celebrated writers on the science, particularly of
the founder or founders of it; “in this case, whether
the term be a new one born with the science, or an
old one used in a new sense, it will not be strange
to the generality of readers, or liable to be misunderstood.”<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c016'><sup>[469]</sup></a>
If any word must have a different
meaning from that adopted by either of these authorities,
the new sense must not only be free from the
faults of the old, but must have a clear and recognizable
positive usefulness. The new definitions
should be consistent with the old; and the same
terms should be used in the same sense, except where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>inveterate custom insists on an exception. When
all is done, it is still impossible in a social science
like political economy to find a definition entirely
beyond cavil.<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c016'><sup>[470]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>“Wealth” must include all the “material objects
that are necessary, useful, or agreeable to mankind;”<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c016'><sup>[471]</sup></a>
“productive labour” must be the labour which
realizes itself either in such material objects or the
increased value of them; or else we wander from
common language, and our discussions travel off into
indefiniteness. Economical reasoning must be a deduction
from observed facts of nature and of human
nature verified by general experience. Malthus
professes to have used this cautious method throughout,
and the theory of population was only the
particular instance where circumstances enabled him
to make his verification most complete. “I should
never have had that steady and unshaken confidence
in the theory of population which I have invariably
felt, if it had not appeared to me to be confirmed,
in the most remarkable manner, by the state of
society as it actually exists in every country with
which we are acquainted.”<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c016'><sup>[472]</sup></a> On the other hand,
Ricardo, legislating for Saturn, gives us little or
no verification by experience. It is true that he
admits qualifications and exceptions to his own statements;
and he would have winced a little at his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>biographer’s assertion that “Mr. Ricardo paid comparatively
little attention to the practical application
of general principles; his is not a practical work.”<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c016'><sup>[473]</sup></a>
But he makes no use of the admissions; his illustrations
as a rule are not historical, but imaginary cases
and the verification is wanting. In a letter to
Malthus (written on the 24th November, 1820) he
says: “Our differences may in some respects, I think,
be ascribed to your considering my book as more
practical than I intended it to be. My object was
to elucidate principles, and to do this I imagined
strong cases, that I might show the operation of
these principles.”<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c016'><sup>[474]</sup></a> In Malthus and Adam Smith,
imaginary cases are rare exceptions, actual examples
from life or history are the rule. Malthus goes so
far in this direction that (to use his own phraseology)
he is tempted to subordinate science to “utility.”
Even Adam Smith, though he had abundance of
good-will to his kind, did not write to do good but
to expound truth. To Malthus the discovery of
truth was less important than the improvement of
society. When an economical truth could not be
made the means of improvement, he seems to have
lost interest in it. His pointed warning to others
against this error<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c016'><sup>[475]</sup></a> may be regarded as a confession
of his own liability to it; and, if he obeyed his own
warning at all, his position was at the best like
that of the latter-day utilitarians, who try to reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>happiness by making believe not to think of it.
If his science had been less biassed by utility, it
might have been more thorough; and we might not
have had in our own time a Ricardian socialism,
appearing like the ghost of the deceased Ricardian
orthodoxy sitting crowned upon the grave thereof.
He has the virtue of refusing to join the economical
Pharisees,<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c016'><sup>[476]</sup></a> who would not admit the elasticity of
economical laws, lest they should discredit their
science; but he is to blame for not pushing his
quarrel against Ricardo with the same energy as
against Godwin. His forces, in this campaign, were
worse drilled and worse handled. It is justly said by
Garnier (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dict. de l’Écon. Pol.</span></cite>, art. ‘Malthus’), that in
spite of its title, the <cite>Political Economy</cite> of Malthus is
not the exposition of a system, but simply a collection
of economical papers on various subjects that had
been brought specially under his notice in discussion
with his friends, or (we might add) in his college
class. This itself would lead him to present a much
less solid front to the enemy than he did in the <cite>Essay</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>To come, in the third place, to Details, we find the
human character of the <cite>Political Economy</cite> of Malthus
appearing not only in his view of population, where all
is at last made to depend on the personal responsibility
of the individual man, and legislation is good or bad
according as it strengthens or weakens that responsibility,—but
in his view of the Value of goods, as
measured by human labour,—in his view of demand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>and supply, as sharing the inconstancy of the human
desires that enter into both of them,—in his view
of the Rent of land, as determined by the effects of
human industry and skill as well as by the natural
qualities of the soil,—in his view of the Wages of
labour, as regulated not by an unchangeable but by
a progressive minimum,—in his view of luxury, as
being equally with parsimony necessary to production,
and preventive of over-production,—and in his
view of free trade, as a rule to which we must make
exceptions if we would not cause sufferings.</p>

<p class='c007'>These doctrines had a distinct relation to current
events. Political and social changes were reacting
on political economy. As Godwin and Pitt provoked
the essay of 1798, the scarcity of 1799 and 1800
called forth the pamphlet on High Prices (1800). As
the latter bears directly on the Poor Law, it will
best be considered when the thread of the <cite>Essay on
Population</cite> is taken up again;<a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c016'><sup>[477]</sup></a> and the same applies
to the letter of Malthus to Whitbread (1807). The
distresses of a time when wheat went so high as £6
the quarter instead of its normal 40<em>s.</em> or 50<em>s.</em>, would
naturally make the relief of the poor a question of the
day. The high prices of corn increased the number
of enclosures and Enclosure Bills. More than three
millions of acres, or about a twelfth part of the
entire area of England and Wales, are said to have
been taken from waste into cultivation between 1800
and 1820. The average price of wheat, always the
staple food of the people when they could get it, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>been 55<em>s.</em> 11<em>d.</em> for the years preceding, viz. from 1790
to 1799 inclusive; it was 82<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> from 1800 to 1809
inclusive, and 88<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> from 1810 to 1819 inclusive,
after which it fell (for the next decade) to 58<em>s.</em> 5<em>d.</em><a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c016'><sup>[478]</sup></a>
In 1883–4 it was 35<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> a quarter, which means a
four-pound loaf (of medium quality) at 4½<em>d.</em> or 5<em>d.</em>;
but at its lowest during the war (in 1803) it was at
57<em>s.</em> 1<em>d.</em>, and the loaf was at 6¾<em>d.</em> or 7<em>d.</em></p>

<p class='c007'>Yet agriculture had not been standing still. Arthur
Young, whose eccentric energy benefited every one
but himself, and fell little short of genius, betted his
nineteen volumes of <cite>Annals of Agriculture</cite> against Sir
John Sinclair’s twenty-one volumes of the <cite>Statistical
Account of Scotland</cite>, that the Government of Pitt
would not establish a Board of Agriculture. But
Farmer George did establish one, in 1793;<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c016'><sup>[479]</sup></a> Young
paid his bet and became Secretary; Sinclair gained his
nineteen volumes and became President of the new
Board; and together they did much to make farmers
and landlords aware of the rotations of crops, disuse
of fallows, new manures, road-makings, that the
Secretary had been preaching in vain for thirty years.<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c016'><sup>[480]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>When the great scarcities of 1799–1800 took place,
the Board was equal to the occasion. It urged the
Government to get supplies of rice from India; it
preached earnestly the cultivation of waste lands and
the temporary conversion of grass lands into cornfields.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The last was done widely enough when the
prices of corn were high. The second, except when it
meant enclosure of commons, was hardly done at all;
and there was a strange impression that the efforts
of the Board were at bottom a political movement
against ecclesiastical titles and the Established Church.
The importation of rice would have been of immense
immediate service; but by the time the order had
reached India and the rice ships had come back to
England,<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c016'><sup>[481]</sup></a> the famine was over, the people preferred
wheat, and £350,000 of bounty were thrown away.<a id='r482'></a><a href='#f482' class='c016'><sup>[482]</sup></a>
Nothing shows the insularity of English commercial
policy better than the remedies generally proposed
in those days for curing the evils of a bad harvest.
The House of Commons passed self-denying ordinances<a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c016'><sup>[483]</sup></a>
and brown-bread bills, and offered a bounty
on potatoes.<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c016'><sup>[484]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There was some talk inside the House of enforcing
a minimum rate of wages, and outside of enforcing a
maximum price of bread. The people were told to
eat red herrings instead of bread; philanthropic soup
shops were opened; distilleries and starch manufactories
were threatened with prohibition. Relief
from the poor rates was, however, the favourite way
of cutting the knot. Better that our people should
depend on each other than on the foreigner. This
fear of dependence was the more pardonable then, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>there were times, in the war with Napoleon, when
England was more completely alone against the
world than she is ever likely to be again. It was
a much more culpable folly to pretend<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c016'><sup>[485]</sup></a> that the
scarcity was due to “forestalling and regrating,”<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c016'><sup>[486]</sup></a> and
that England could have provided for herself well
enough, even in 1799 and 1800, but for the corn-dealers
and the large farms and the enclosures and
the new-fashioned husbandry. The new learning,
however, went on its way.<a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c016'><sup>[487]</sup></a> The benefits of it may
have gone to farmer<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c016'><sup>[488]</sup></a> or to landlord,—the question
was much debated,—but they did not go to the
labourers. The same is true of the improvements in
cattle-breeding introduced by Bakewell of Leicester
and Chaplin of Lincoln, and encouraged by the Smithfield
Club (1798), which has long outlived the Board
of Agriculture. The life of the country labourers was
little changed. They and their wages could not
remain entirely unaffected by the growth of manufacturing
towns. But custom still had the chief
power over wages, and had no little influence on
rents. From the reports sent from the Scotch,
English, and Welsh counties to the Board of Agriculture
in 1794, it does not appear that wages were
at all, or rent very closely, in correspondence with the
amount of the produce.<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c016'><sup>[489]</sup></a> Rents were far from being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>rack rents, and wages were far from varying with
the necessary expenses of the labourer. In truth
each country district in the days before railways and
steamboats was nearly in the same isolation with
regard to the rest as all England was with regard
to foreign nations. The price of farm produce was
indeed tending to be equal over England, as now
over the world. Wages were displaying no such
tendency. Of all goods a man is the most difficult
to move,<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c016'><sup>[490]</sup></a> for you must first persuade him; and
human inertia by making men stationary will keep
wages low. So it was in 1794. The exertions of
landlord and tenant were directed therefore rather to
keep up corn than to keep down wages. They were
beginning to fear for their monopoly of the corn
market. The English Government had done its best
to keep their market for them. A law of Charles
II. passed in 1670 virtually prohibited importation
of foreign wheat till the price of home wheat was
over 53<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em> a quarter, and made it free only when
the home price was 80<em>s.</em> The Revolution of 1688
brought a new phase of commercial policy. The
new rulers, to conciliate the agricultural classes and
atone for the burdens which had been transferred
to them from the industrial classes, granted a bounty
of 5<em>s.</em> a quarter on the exportation of wheat so long
as the home price was not over 48<em>s.</em> In this
way, after exportation in the days of the Romans,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and alternate exportation and importation according
to the seasons in after times, there was, after the Revolution,
exportation encouraged by a bounty, while importation
was still hindered by duties. The intention
was at once to attract capitalists to agriculture and to
reward those already engaged in it. By this means
not only would the farmers be attached to the new
dynasty, but England would provide all her own food.<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c016'><sup>[491]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But the very increase of tillage kept down prices
and gave the landowners little benefit. Whenever a
scarcity occurred the laws were suspended, and the
bounty and duties were taken off together.<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c016'><sup>[492]</sup></a> Exportation,
however, was the rule till a little after the middle
of the century, say at the beginning of George III.’s
reign, when the tide had fairly turned. Especially
after the Peace of Paris (Nov. 1762), commerce was
extended and population with it. Canals were made,
roads improved, and home trade prospered.<a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c016'><sup>[493]</sup></a> We
could no longer raise enough corn for our own wants.<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c016'><sup>[494]</sup></a>
In 1766, the year of our author’s birth, there were
scarcities, Corn Riots, and suspensions of the Corn
Laws;<a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c016'><sup>[495]</sup></a> but the bounty was kept up in name to the
end of the century. In 1795 and 1796 the price of
wheat rose to 80<em>s.</em> a quarter, in 1797 and 1798 it
sank to 54<em>s.</em>; but, at the end of harvest, 1799, it rose
to 92<em>s.</em>, in 1800 to 128<em>s.</em>, and before the harvest of
1801 to 177<em>s.</em> The quartern loaf (under 6<em>d.</em> in 1885)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>was once within ½<em>d.</em> of 2<em>s.</em>! Then came a cycle of
comparative plenty. Wheat between 1802 and 1807
was at 75<em>s.</em> on an average, and a new Corn Law in
1804 prohibited importation till the home price should
rise to 63<em>s.</em> Between 1808 and 1813 it was 108<em>s.</em>
on an average; and it was as high as 140<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em> in
the severe winter (1812–13) of Napoleon’s retreat from
Moscow. But in the spring of 1815 wheat was at
60<em>s.</em> If it should rise to 63<em>s.</em> the ports would be
opened, and there was not even the Protection of
war. The farmers and landowners were terror-stricken,
the political economists divided, and the
bill for raising the importation price to 80<em>s.</em> was
hurried through the House. The bounty, relaxed in
1773, had been finally repealed, in 1814.<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c016'><sup>[496]</sup></a> As the
sliding scale of duties was not introduced till 1827,
we are to regard Malthus and Ricardo as writing on
rent (in 1815 and 1820) under the severe Corn Law
of 1815, as well as when the wisdom of passing that
measure was still under debate. All their discussions
on rent bear consciously or unconsciously upon
the Corn Laws of their own time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus is rightly considered the first clear expounder
in England of the economical doctrine of
rent. Dr. James Anderson, a contemporary of Adam
Smith, was no doubt before his age in his view of the
subject;<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c016'><sup>[497]</sup></a> but, perhaps because he was better known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>as an agriculturist than as an economist, he does not
seem to have made converts. The “simultaneous
rediscovery” of the true doctrine by West and
Malthus in 1815 may be compared with the simultaneous
discovery of the Darwinian theory by Wallace
and Darwin in 1859. The times were ripe for it.
Malthus gives no certain sound on the subject in the
early editions of the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>. In the
second he even says that “one of the principal
ingredients in the price of British corn is the high
rent of land” (p. 460; cf. p. 444). However, needing
to lecture on Rent to his pupils at Haileybury in
1805, he saw the unsoundness of this position, and in
1806, in the third edition of the essay, the passage is
dropped, and we are told, “universally it is price that
determines rent, not rent that determines price” (vol.
ii. p. 266). The passage is repeated in the fourth
edition (1807).<a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c016'><sup>[498]</sup></a> But when the time came for a fifth
edition, in 1817, the whole of the chapters on Corn
Laws and bounties, which are the only chapters of the
essay that deal much with rent, were recast, to express
the clearer views which the author had already
expounded elsewhere. In the spring of 1814, in the
excitement of debates on the abolition of the bounty
and on new laws to keep out foreign grain, Malthus
was led for the fourth or fifth time in his life to take
the field as a pamphleteer.<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c016'><sup>[499]</sup></a> This time, however, he
came forward, he said, not to take a side but to act
as arbitrator. His “<cite>Observations on the effects of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>the Corn Laws</cite>, and of a rise or fall in the price of
corn on the agriculture and general wealth of the
country” (1814),<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c016'><sup>[500]</sup></a> professed to balance the arguments
for and against the Corn Laws, and did it, he said,
so judiciously, that his own friends were in doubt to
which opinion he leaned.<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c016'><sup>[501]</sup></a> To later readers the bias
is not doubtful. It appears even in such a passage as
the following, which, incidentally, shows us his view
of rent, nearly matured:—“It is a great mistake to
suppose that the effects of a fall in the price of corn
on cultivation may be fully compensated by a diminution
of rents. Rich land, which yields a large nett
rent, may be kept up in its actual state, notwithstanding
a fall in the price of its produce, as a diminution
of rent may be made entirely to compensate this fall,
and all the additional expenses that belong to a rich
and highly-taxed country. But in poor land the
fund of rent will often be found quite insufficient for
this purpose. There is a good deal of land in this
country of such a quality, that the expenses of its
cultivation, together with the outgoings of poor’s
rates, tithes, and taxes, will not allow the farmer to
pay more than a fifth or sixth of the value of the
whole produce in the shape of rent. If we were to
suppose the prices of grain to fall from 75<em>s.</em> to 50<em>s.</em>
the quarter, the whole of such a rent would be
absorbed, even if the price of the whole produce of the
farm did not fall in proportion to the price of grain,
and making some allowance for a fall in the price of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>labour. The regular cultivation of such land for
grain would of course be given up, and any sort of
pasture, however scanty, would be more beneficial
both to the landlord and farmer.”<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c016'><sup>[502]</sup></a> The drift of the
pamphlet may be shortly stated. The writer refused
to go with Adam Smith in identifying corn with
food, and attributing to it in that capacity an unchangeable
value, which made any rise of price
futile for the encouragement of tillage. He thought
that it was perfectly possible to encourage tillage by
Corn Laws; but was it good policy? Before he
could answer this question, he felt bound to consider
several others.<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c016'><sup>[503]</sup></a> Under free trade would Great
Britain grow her own corn?—if not, ought Government
to interfere to secure this?—if so, would laws to
hinder importation be the best kind of interference?
The answer to the first is, that other countries have
soils more fertile than Britain; Poland can ship corn
at Dantzig for England at 32<em>s.</em> a quarter;<a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c016'><sup>[504]</sup></a> and, if there
were free trade over Europe, the rich lands which are
not English would send their plenty to relieve the
wants of their neighbours. If Corn Laws have not
made us grow our own corn, free trade would not. In
answer to the second question, no doubt it is sound
economy to buy in the cheapest market and sell in
the dearest; and, if we had regard to nothing but the
greatest “wealth, population, and power,” the rule
would be invariable; foreign imports of food are in
every case a good thing for the country, and, if there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>is evil in the matter, it is not in them but in the bad
season which makes them necessary; moreover, a free
trade in corn secures a steadier as well as cheaper
supply of grain.<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c016'><sup>[505]</sup></a> But, on the other hand, dependence
on other nations for the first necessary of life is a
source of political insecurity to the nation so depending;
and, though the dependence is mutual, identity
of commercial interests seldom prevents nations from
going to war with each other; “we have latterly seen
the most striking instances, in all quarters, of Governments
acting from passion rather than interest.”<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c016'><sup>[506]</sup></a>
And it might be argued that, if we give up agriculture
for manufacture, we change the character of our
people; manufacturing industry conduces to mental
activity, to an expansion of comforts, to the growth
of the middle classes, and to the growth with them
of political moderation; but it is more subject than
agriculture to the fluctuations of fashion, which lead
to chronic destitution and discontent, and the conditions
of artizan life are “even in their best state
unfavourable to health and virtue.”<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c016'><sup>[507]</sup></a> Virtue and
happiness after all are the end; wealth, population,
and power are but the means. Malthus himself
believes in something like a golden mean, a balance
of the two industries, which legislation might possibly
preserve.<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c016'><sup>[508]</sup></a> There is another and less plausible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>argument on the same side. Assuming that wages
vary with the price of corn, high money wages, and
therefore high prices of corn, are an advantage to
working men, who would have more money to buy
the goods of the foreign countries where prices of
corn were low and goods were cheap. This argument,
though our author is inclined to yield to it,
is inconsistent with his own views of wages and the
facts he cites in support of them.<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c016'><sup>[509]</sup></a> More cogent is
the plea that it would be unfair suddenly to withdraw
a long-established protection, though (it might
be replied) we are no more bound to be gradual in
abolishing protection than in concluding peace during
war. But the real question is, whether once protected
is to mean always protected, and protected in an
always increasing degree, for it was this increased
protection that was proposed in 1814 and 1815. It
may be true that if we protect manufacture we ought
to protect agriculture; but, instead of protecting both,
why not set both free? Statesmen had no courage,
however, to be free-traders, in days when the separate
articles protected were as many as the millions in the
National Debt, and each article represented a vested
interest. Malthus does not seem to expect Parliament
to give free trade a moment’s consideration.
But the friends of the new Corn Laws, besides using
the commonplaces of protectionism, argued from the
change in the value of the English currency. When
paper were paper prices,<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c016'><sup>[510]</sup></a> the importation price of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>law of 1804 could be soon reached, and foreign corn
came in much faster than the real or the bullion
prices of it would have allowed. There was also
the long array of standing arguments for Corn Laws
that lay stress on the heavy taxation of the country,
and are meant to show that the agricultural classes
bear most of it, and are thus handicapped against
the foreigner. From Malthus himself the old leaven
of protectionism was never wholly purged away.
Like Pitt, though in a less degree, he suffered his
politics to corrupt his political economy, and drag
him back from the “simple system of natural liberty”
into “the mazes of the old system.”<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c016'><sup>[511]</sup></a> English people
since the Repeal of the Corn Laws will hardly care
to thrash the old straw out again. Perronet Thompson’s
<cite>Catechism of the Corn Laws</cite> is the best storehouse
of the old arguments and their refutations, set forth
with a liveliness to which no other English economical
writing has the slightest claim.<a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c016'><sup>[512]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The real opinion of Malthus came out in the second
Corn Law pamphlet on the <cite>Grounds of an Opinion on
the Policy of restricting the Importation of Foreign
Corn</cite> (1815). Between the two came the tract on
Rent, which is rather an economical book than a
political pamphlet, and will be noticed immediately.
He now declares himself in favour of a temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>duty on imported corn to countervail the artificially
low value of the currency,—“to get rid of that part
of our prices which belongs to great wealth, combined
with a system of restrictions.”<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c016'><sup>[513]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>He warns the Government that they should not take
such a step to benefit a particular trade, but only to
benefit the public. The motives are those constantly
professed by defenders of the Navigation Act—not
private interests but public policy. Since he wrote
his <cite>Observations</cite> circumstances had changed. The
sudden peace had brought the then unprecedented
combination of a bad harvest and low prices; the
value of the currency had fallen fast; and last, and
not least, France, the best corn country in Europe,
had begun to prohibit the exportation of grain<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c016'><sup>[514]</sup></a> in
dear years. We must therefore, he says, keep up the
high farming which the war taught us, by keeping up
the high prices of the war. Eighty shillings might
not be too high a price, for the limit of prohibited
importation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems extraordinary that, after so clearly recognizing
that “wealth does not consist in the dearness
or cheapness of the usual measures of value, but in
the quantity of produce,” and that exports are not
so good a criterion of wealth as the “quantity of
produce consumed at home,”<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c016'><sup>[515]</sup></a> Malthus should recommend
the increase of abundance by means of artificial
dearness. It is a poor consolation to us that he was
no worse than Brougham, who voted for the Corn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Law in 1815, and for the support of the Navigation
Act in 1849,—and little worse than Ricardo, who
would allow a temporary restriction for the sake of
leaseholders.<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c016'><sup>[516]</sup></a> A better is that he was advocating a
policy that was against his private interests as a
holder of a fixed salary and owner of three per cents.<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c016'><sup>[517]</sup></a>
But at the best the atmosphere of these two tracts is
a little depressing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tract on Rent is more bracing. It was the
first-fruits of the larger work on <cite>Political Economy</cite>
(1820); and its substance had been delivered in the
professor’s lectures at Haileybury. It expounds the
<cite>Nature and Progress of Rent</cite> with clearness and
intelligibility, if without the liveliness of 1798.
Malthus gives us to understand that, to explain this
or any other economical notion, we must keep as
closely as possible to the usage of ordinary language,
the language of clear-thinking ordinary men.<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c016'><sup>[518]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>To them, rent does not mean, as by derivation,
simply produce or profit; nor, as to a Frenchman
now and to Bailie Nicol Jarvie in his days, interest
on a debt. It means a certain price paid to a landlord
for the use of his land. But such a definition
is too wide. It might include the proceeds of a
monopoly, or an interest on capital, or a Government
tax, or a legal rate, or a toll, or a payment for
service rendered. We must define the term a little
more clearly.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a certain portion of a landlord’s income
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>and of a peasant proprietor’s earnings that has an
origin and character distinct from the rest, and
demands the economist’s separate attention, whether
it alone receives the name of rent or not;—this is,
the excess of the produce of land beyond the cost
of production and the current rate of profits. Represent
these in money; and suppose the current
profit five per cent. Suppose that a tenant lays out
£500 on his farm, and gets by the harvest and
farm produce not only £500 plus £25, but £600;
the additional £75, which would if retained by him
be over or extra profits as compared with the rate
usual among farmers and men of like business, is the
value of his rent; and the landlord can take that
from him without impoverishing him. Rent is that
portion of the produce which remains, after all the
outlay of the cultivator has been repaid him together
with the current profits. From accidental or temporary
causes the money rents of land may be more or
less than this; but this is the point to which actual
rents will gravitate.<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c016'><sup>[519]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So far as this account goes, it might seem that
Malthus’ description is too general; it would include
the extra profits, for example, of any monopoly or a
royalty for the use of a patent; and Ricardo’s definition,
“the price paid for the indestructible powers of
the soil,” might seem more definite. But Malthus is
rather too specific than too general. He is thinking
of agricultural land only, and that mainly as producing
food for man. If his description of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Nature of rent adds little to that of Adam Smith,<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c016'><sup>[520]</sup></a>
his account of its Causes, which he himself was the
first to grasp, is characteristic and peculiar.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, he says, fertile<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c016'><sup>[521]</sup></a> soils yield a produce that
more than feeds the producer. This may be put
more generally than Malthus has put it. If rent
is to be paid, there must be wherewithal to pay
it; and there cannot be so if production does no
more than repay cost. There may, however, be a
production beyond mere repayment of cost, not only
in farming but in all trades. The very principle
of the division of labour and the separation of
trades implies that devotion to one occupation makes
men so dexterous in production that, besides providing
for themselves, they have an overplus wherewith
to supply their other wants and the wants of
others.<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c016'><sup>[522]</sup></a> This overplus, where the facilities for trading
were specially good, might be so much above the
overplus of an ordinary profit that the granter of
the facilities, who is usually the ground landlord,
might get the lion’s share of it, and still leave the
user of the facilities as thriving as his neighbours.
On the other hand, if no such overplus can be earned,
no such rent can be paid. Rent, in short, when it
is paid by men of business, either in town or in
country, means over-profits, and ground-rents mean
advantage of situation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>The second cause of rent, according to Malthus,
who is considering, be it remembered, the cause of
the Progress of rents as well as of their actual volume
at any given time,<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c016'><sup>[523]</sup></a> is the peculiarity belonging
to agricultural land, that the demand increases with
the supply; in other cases the demand is external
to the supply, but in this case<a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c016'><sup>[524]</sup></a> the supply creates its
demand. Where there is food there will be mouths.
In the supply of food no over-production is possible.<a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c016'><sup>[525]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is here that the <cite>Essay on Rent</cite> is connected with
the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>. By the law of population
the tendency is that where food enough for six is
being produced by two, the other four will soon
make their appearance; and so, thinks Malthus, the
farmer makes his customers by simply making his
wares. Something like this, we might add, would
happen in a completely developed co-operative society,
where the makers would sell to each other and buy
from each other. It is even true, in a sense, of all
manufacturers as things now are, in proportion as
their articles come near to being necessaries;—if
they supply that without which people cannot live,
they go far to bring people into being. Malthus,
however, regarded it as much more true of agricultural
production than of any other. He regarded
food as the chief necessary, and thought with Adam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>Smith, that “when food is provided it is comparatively
easy to find the necessary clothing and
lodging.”<a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c016'><sup>[526]</sup></a> Against this we need only remember,
how the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> showed that it was
only in the lower stages of existence that increase
of mere food involved increase of population; and so
the tendency of the supply to create its own demand
was, on the author’s own showing, nothing more
than a tendency.<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c016'><sup>[527]</sup></a> His economical reasoning was
swayed a little by his circumstances. The insularity
of English life in his days prevented him from conceiving
how a nation could safely derive half its
food from abroad; what Adam Smith had thought
too good to be likely,<a id='r528'></a><a href='#f528' class='c016'><sup>[528]</sup></a> he thought too dangerous to
be desirable. Good or bad, it is our position now, and
the result is, first, that the supply of food does not, in
the same degree or way, produce its own demand
as formerly, and, second, that our other productions
are, even more truly than the agricultural, the supply
that creates its own demand, for they give the power
of buying the food that feeds new demanders. The
production carried on, on the surface of the land, has
come in this way to be a more potent cause of the
Progress of rents than production from the soil itself.
With this restatement the second of Malthus’ causes
of rent becomes perhaps a little more intelligible.</p>

<p class='c007'>His third cause is that good land is scarce. Lands
differ in fertility, and there is not, as in a new
country, enough of the most fertile to supply all our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>wants. When the produce of the inferior begins to
be absolutely necessary, the inferior will be cultivated
at a price enough to repay cost and give ordinary
profits to the farmer. But what is simply enough to
do that for him will do much more than that for all
the holders of superior lands, and all that is much
more can be taken by a landlord as rent without
placing the tenant at any disadvantage as compared
with his neighbours. As soon as this happens in a
country, the extra profits, which are called by economists
rent, will appear in it; and the growth of
population, by leading to an increased demand for
food and to an increased price of it, will cause the
cultivation of inferior lands, or else a more expensive
cultivation of the old ones; and again, since the
necessary new supplies cannot be permanently kept
up without one or other of these two resources, the
price, and with it the rent, will, in the absence of
inventions, remain permanently higher. In other
words, this third cause is the “law of diminishing
returns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this law of diminishing returns which bulks
most largely in the tract of Sir Edward West, written
in the same year as that of Malthus. West’s theory
of rent is simply, “that in the progress of the
improvement of cultivation the raising of rude produce
becomes progressively more expensive, or in
other words, the ratio of the net produce of land
to the gross produce is continually diminishing.”<a id='r529'></a><a href='#f529' class='c016'><sup>[529]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>He sees how near Adam Smith came to it when he
said, that in the progress of cultivation the total
amount of rent increased, but the proportion of it
to the produce diminished, so that from being <em>e. g.</em>
half the produce it became one-third.<a id='r530'></a><a href='#f530' class='c016'><sup>[530]</sup></a> He sees, as
even in 1798 Malthus had seen,<a id='r531'></a><a href='#f531' class='c016'><sup>[531]</sup></a> that but for this
law population might increase indefinitely on a few
fertile lands instead of spreading over the globe
(West, p. 13), whereas because of this law inventions
in agriculture are not able to remove “the necessity
of having recourse to inferior land, and of bestowing
capital with diminished advantage on land already
in tillage” (p. 50). He pushes the principle so far
as to say broadly that whatever increases agricultural
production increases cost, while whatever increases
manufacturing production diminishes cost (p. 48),
inferring that the former must tend abroad and
the latter at home to prevent the displacement of
English agriculture by foreign competition. As he
had little or no influence on Malthus, his tract need
not be noticed in detail; it is enough to say that,
while West is superior in style and arrangement,
Malthus is the more comprehensive. West is clearer
and simpler because he includes less.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking at the three causes together, we see that
the first and last relate to the statics, and the second
to the dynamics of the subject. We need to remember
that Malthus is having regard in the first instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>not to the value but to the quantity of the produce.
Now, apart from questions of value, it is possible there
might be, in a country, land yielding to the sower more
than he sowed; but it might be an ordinary excess,
secured by all producers in that country, for the land
might be all equally fertile, and production from
land might be the most fertile of industries. In that
case, even if the land was a State monopoly and the
producer’s gains could be taken from him by a tax,
there would be nothing corresponding to rent, in the
received sense. But, as soon as there were differences
in the fertility, and therefore differences in the
quantity produced at the same cost, the farmer who
had the difference on his side could be said to have
a rent. It is this surplus, conjoined with the institution
of private property, that, according to Malthus,
makes leisure and mental progress, and even great
material prosperity, possible.<a id='r532'></a><a href='#f532' class='c016'><sup>[532]</sup></a> The rent is properly
the extra profits, and not the equivalent paid over
for them to a landlord; rent can easily exist without
a landlord. “It may be laid down, therefore, as an
incontrovertible truth, that, as a nation reaches any
considerable degree of wealth, and any considerable
fulness of population, which of course cannot take
place without a great fall both in the profits of stock
and the wages of labour, the separation of rents, as a
kind of fixture upon lands of a certain quality, is a
law as invariable as the action of the principle of
gravity. And that rents are neither a mere nominal
value, nor a value unnecessarily and injuriously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>transferred from one set of people to another, but a
most real and essential part of the whole value of
the national property, and placed by the laws of
nature where they are, on the land, by whomsoever
possessed, whether the landlord, the crown, or the
actual cultivator.”<a id='r533'></a><a href='#f533' class='c016'><sup>[533]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is the second cause that brings the first and third
into operation in such a way as to produce the rents
that we actually know in an old country. The fertility
which secures a produce beyond cost makes extra
profits possible; the growing population, which gives
the produce a value, makes them actual; and the
gradations in fertility, whereby a uniform increase in
the value of produce creates far from uniform extra
profits to different cultivators, give the extra profits
the peculiar graduated character, which is characteristic
of rent in the economical sense of the word.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus believed himself to have included, in this
theory of rent, what truth there was in the view of
the French economists and of Adam Smith, when
they spoke of rent as due to the qualities of the soil
and not to an ordinary monopoly. His contemporaries
admitted him to have been the first clear expounder
of the subject. But his most eminent brother economist
found general agreement quite consistent with
emphatic divergence in details,<a id='r534'></a><a href='#f534' class='c016'><sup>[534]</sup></a> not wonderful in a
writer who regarded every economical question as a
particular case of the problem of value rather than of
wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Ricardo admits that his own theory of rent is
simply a farther development of the Malthusian. In
an essay on <cite>The Influence of a low price of Corn on
the Profits of Stock, showing the inexpediency of Restrictions
on Importation</cite> (1815),<a id='r535'></a><a href='#f535' class='c016'><sup>[535]</sup></a> published in answer
to the two tracts of Malthus above mentioned, he
makes this quite clear, and, unlike his disciples, is
warm in praise of his rival’s powers as an economist.<a id='r536'></a><a href='#f536' class='c016'><sup>[536]</sup></a>
He agrees with the definition (of the <cite>Tract on Rent</cite>)
that rent is “that portion of the value of the whole
produce which remains to the owner after all the
outgoings belonging to its cultivation have been
paid,” including an ordinary rate of profits for the
employed.<a id='r537'></a><a href='#f537' class='c016'><sup>[537]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But, whereas Malthus regards rent as increased by
whatever lessens the outgoings in any shape or form,
Ricardo considers that can happen in one way only,
namely, by the increased cost of raising the last part of
the necessary supplies. Arithmetically it was clear
that, if you had four items making up the total
expense of cultivation, whatever reduced any one of
the items <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tanto</span></i> reduced the total.<a id='r538'></a><a href='#f538' class='c016'><sup>[538]</sup></a> Accordingly,
Malthus said that rent could be increased by such an
accumulation of capital as will lower the profits of
stock,—such an increase of population as will lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the wages of labour,—such agricultural improvements
or such increase of the cultivator’s exertions
as will diminish the number of labourers needed,—or
such an increase in the prices of produce from
increased demand as will increase the difference
between the expense of production and the price of
produce.<a id='r539'></a><a href='#f539' class='c016'><sup>[539]</sup></a> Ricardo, on the other hand, says that
profits can never be reduced by mere accumulation of
capital or competition of capitals, but only by the
progressively less fruitful character of the investments
to be found for capital as accumulation goes on. As
long as there is fertile land to be had, yielding a rich
return to capital, no one will accept a poor return.
“If in the progress of countries in wealth and population
new portions of fertile land can be added to
such countries with every increase of capital, profits
would never fall nor rents rise.”<a id='r540'></a><a href='#f540' class='c016'><sup>[540]</sup></a> In things as they
are, capital soon accumulates beyond the rich investments
and has to take the poorer. Sooner or later,
even in a new colony, a point is reached where fertile
land will not supply food enough for the growing
population except at an increased cost.<a id='r541'></a><a href='#f541' class='c016'><sup>[541]</sup></a> Now, if the
supply is absolutely required, the most costly portion
of it, whether it be got by an extension of cultivation
to poorer lands, or by a more thorough cultivation
of the richer, will determine the price of all the rest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>for there cannot be two prices in the same market;
and the profits of the producer of it will determine
the profits of all his fellow-cultivators, for there
cannot be two rates of profit in the same business.
Furthermore, the agricultural profits will determine
the rate in other businesses, for in a full-formed society
the rate in the others must bear a fixed relation to
the rate in this business, so that the one cannot
materially vary without the other.<a id='r542'></a><a href='#f542' class='c016'><sup>[542]</sup></a> Therefore the
greater cost of the last portion of the necessary supply
of food will lower profits generally, will thereby
increase the range of extra profits from the richer
soils, and will thereby raise rents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference between the two men is, that what
Malthus makes only one cause, Ricardo makes the only
one, the increased cost of cultivation.<a id='r543'></a><a href='#f543' class='c016'><sup>[543]</sup></a> Ricardo and
his friends have certainly put cause for effect.<a id='r544'></a><a href='#f544' class='c016'><sup>[544]</sup></a> It is
of course in the first instance the high prices that
lead to the costly cultivation, and not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versâ</span></i>, for
without the high prices the produce of the costly
cultivation would not be profitable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus was asked by the Committee on Emigration:
“Among other effects of resorting to a soil
inferior to any now in cultivation, which is involved
in the proposition of cultivating waste lands, would
not one be to raise the rents of all the landlords
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>throughout Great Britain and Ireland?”—He answered:
“I think not. The cultivating of poor lands
is not the cause of the rise of rents; the rise of the
price of produce compared with the costs of production,
which is the cause of the rise of rents, takes
place first, and then such rise induces the cultivation
of the poorer land. That is the doctrine I originally
stated, and I believe it to be true; it was altered by
others afterwards.”<a id='r545'></a><a href='#f545' class='c016'><sup>[545]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, what makes the high prices
permanent instead of temporary, is the fact that the
cultivation essential to the completeness of the supply
cannot be other than costly.<a id='r546'></a><a href='#f546' class='c016'><sup>[546]</sup></a> It is, therefore, not
wrong to consider costly cultivation as one cause of
the permanence of high prices, and therewith of high
rents. But Ricardo goes further, and counts it the
only cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the whole progress of society, he says,
profits are regulated by the difficulty or facility of
procuring food; and, “if the smallness of profits do
not check accumulation, there are hardly any limits
to the rise of rent and the fall of profit.” Nothing
can increase the general rate of profit but the cheapening
of food;<a id='r547'></a><a href='#f547' class='c016'><sup>[547]</sup></a> as by improvements in agriculture,
which, by securing the same production with less
labour, for the time increase the profits and lower
the rents.<a id='r548'></a><a href='#f548' class='c016'><sup>[548]</sup></a> The landlord’s interest is therefore at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>times opposed to that of every other class in the
community,<a id='r549'></a><a href='#f549' class='c016'><sup>[549]</sup></a> for it means dear food, low profits, and
high rents. Still, high rents are not the cause either
of the dear food or the low profits, but are, equally
with them, the effect of a common cause, more costly
cultivation. The effect of a costly cultivation on
wages might seem <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi terminorum</span></i> to be a raising of
them, for wages depend on the proportion of the
supply of labourers to capital’s demand<a id='r550'></a><a href='#f550' class='c016'><sup>[550]</sup></a> for them,
and by assumption there was a greater demand. But
since the cause of the rise of price was in the first
instance an increase of population, it follows that the
increased cost of raising the most costly supplies of
corn will be incurred not by higher payment of old
labourers, but by employment of new. Wages again
will buy less corn, for corn has risen. “While the
price of corn rises ten per cent., wages will always
rise less than ten per cent., but rent will always
rise more; the condition of the labourer will generally
decline, and that of the landlord will always be improved.”<a id='r551'></a><a href='#f551' class='c016'><sup>[551]</sup></a>
In his statement of the doctrine of wages,
Ricardo is perhaps more careful in 1815 than he is
in 1817, saying that, “as experience demonstrates
that capital and population alternately take the lead,
and wages in consequence are liberal or scanty, nothing
can be positively laid down respecting profits as far
as wages are concerned.”<a id='r552'></a><a href='#f552' class='c016'><sup>[552]</sup></a> But even in 1817 his
exposition is hardly more rigid than that of Malthus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>himself. So far is he from recognizing an iron law
driving wages down to “the natural price” or bare
necessaries, that he thinks the market rate may be
constantly above the natural for an indefinite period,
and he regards the natural itself as expansive. The
whole chapter on wages<a id='r553'></a><a href='#f553' class='c016'><sup>[553]</sup></a> shows a just understanding
of the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>. Nevertheless, if Ricardo
in one sense made too much of the principle of population
in relation to Rent, in another sense he made
too little of it. He does not see that in a progressive
country it counteracts the tendency of improvements
in agriculture to cheapen produce, and thereby reduce
rents;<a id='r554'></a><a href='#f554' class='c016'><sup>[554]</sup></a> agricultural rents have risen since 1846 largely
because of high farming. He does not grant that
high or low wages can affect rent, because he regards
them as purely relative to profits, and making with
profits a total amount, of which only the proportions
vary; but it is difficult to believe that the rise in
agricultural wages since 1873 or so can have failed to
play a part in keeping down farmers’ rents since that
date. As, however, our view of the power or powerlessness
of lowered profits or lowered wages to increase
rent will be found to depend on our view of the
causes of value, and as the difference of the two
economists on the relation of wages to profits might
have the appearance of a technical subtlety, these two
items of the total may be passed by for the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to agricultural improvements the issue
seemed plainer, and the evidence seemed all for Ricardo
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>and against Malthus. In a country depending chiefly
on itself for grain, a general adoption of improvements
would seem to make supplies cheaper because less
costly, and therefore to lower rents because forcing
farmers to lower prices. Even Mr. Mill did not
break away from Ricardianism at this point,<a id='r555'></a><a href='#f555' class='c016'><sup>[555]</sup></a> though
he speaks less unreservedly than Ricardo upon it.
Malthus, on the other hand, who regards rent as
depending largely on the ability of the agricultural
supply to create its own demands, regards rent, accordingly,
as at all times keeping pace with the increase
of grain caused by improvements, unless the improvements
outrun population. What cheapness does in
other cases is to make an article accessible to a
circle of buyers previously excluded from it. Every
one is a buyer of agricultural produce and no one
is excluded; but the temporary cheapness of grain
creates new buyers by making marriage accessible
to a wider circle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The progress of rents in fact results from the
conflict of two economical tendencies—the tendency
of economical expedients to lower prices, and the
tendency of an increasing population to raise them.
If Malthus’ ripest view of population be true, then
a cheapening of food among a civilized people by no
means leads to a corresponding increase of their
numbers, and therefore the course of improvement
would tend so far towards a diminution of price, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>therewith of rent. If rents depended on the price of
corn alone, economical expedients (including not only
the direct aids to tillage, mechanical and chemical
inventions directly applied to it, but the indirect aids,
free trade, railways, and steamers) must certainly have
lowered rents in the last hundred years. But the
reverse is true,<a id='r556'></a><a href='#f556' class='c016'><sup>[556]</sup></a> chiefly because the produce of a farm
is ceasing to mean wheat, and coming more and more
to mean cattle and dairy produce, which have not
fallen but risen in price in one hundred years, while
corn has actually fallen. This variety of productions
has proved financially an equivalent to what Malthus
(seventy years ago) considered the main cause of greater
extra profits to the farmer and greater money rents
to the landlord——the increased fertility of the soil in
the matter of grain, and an increased price keeping
pace with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The commercial policy of England has become what
Malthus describes in the latter part of the <cite>Essay on
Population</cite> as a combination of the agricultural and
the commercial systems. His views on this subject
became modified as he grew older. In the second
edition he says:<a id='r557'></a><a href='#f557' class='c016'><sup>[557]</sup></a> “Two nations might increase
exactly with the same rapidity in the exchangeable
value of the annual produce of their land and labour;
yet&#160;... in that which had applied itself chiefly to
agriculture, the poor would live in greater plenty,
and population would rapidly increase; in that which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>had applied itself chiefly to commerce, the poor would
be comparatively but little benefited, and consequently
population would either be stationary or increase very
slowly.” “In the history of the world the nations
whose wealth has been derived principally from
manufactures and commerce have been perfectly
ephemeral beings compared with those the basis of
whose wealth has been agriculture. It is in the nature
of things that a state which subsists upon a revenue
furnished by other countries must be infinitely more
exposed to all the accidents of time and chance than
one which produces its own.”<a id='r558'></a><a href='#f558' class='c016'><sup>[558]</sup></a> It is not, he thinks,
because of her trade, but because of her agriculture
that England is so rich in resources; it is not without
danger that our commercial policy has diverted
capital from agriculture into manufacture and commerce.
About the middle of the eighteenth century
we were strictly an agricultural nation, and we were
safe, for in a country whose commerce and manufacture
increase from and with the improvement in
agriculture there is no discoverable germ of decay.
But all is changed now; and there is reason to fear
that our prosperity is temporary, and we have only
risen by the depression of other nations.<a id='r559'></a><a href='#f559' class='c016'><sup>[559]</sup></a> When the
nations that now supply us with cheap corn shall
have prospered like ourselves and increased their
population till corn is dear among them, then we
shall be ruined. The evils of scarcity are so dreadful
that it is worth our while to give special encouragements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>to agriculture, and, in order to be certain to
have enough, to have in general too much.<a id='r560'></a><a href='#f560' class='c016'><sup>[560]</sup></a> Otherwise
“we shall be laid so bare to the shafts of fortune
that nothing but a miracle can save us from being
struck.”<a id='r561'></a><a href='#f561' class='c016'><sup>[561]</sup></a> “If England continues yearly her importations
of corn, she cannot ultimately escape that
decline which seems to be the natural and necessary
consequence of excessive commercial wealth;
and the growing prosperity of those countries which
supply her with corn must in the end diminish
her population, her riches, and her power,”—not
indeed in the next twenty or thirty years, but “in
the next two hundred or three hundred.”<a id='r562'></a><a href='#f562' class='c016'><sup>[562]</sup></a> In 1803
Malthus had much in common with the author of
<cite>Great Britain independent of Commerce</cite>, to say nothing
of the French economists. He cannot be said to
have entirely lost the bias in favour of Agriculture
in later years. In the <cite>Political Economy</cite>, reviewing
the last five centuries of English work and wages,<a id='r563'></a><a href='#f563' class='c016'><sup>[563]</sup></a>
he tries to explain away the instances where rising
prices of corn and an “influx of bullion” seem to
have injured the condition of the labourer; and there
can be little doubt he was indirectly answering an
objection to Corn Laws. When depreciation of the
currency, whether through American discoveries or
suspensions of cash payment, has occurred, the rebound
from it (he says) has made prices fall much
more than wages, and so (we are to infer), when prices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>are kept high, wages will follow. It may be doubted
if he had weighed the full consequences of such a
contention in the light of his own principles of free
trade. Professor Rogers<a id='r564'></a><a href='#f564' class='c016'><sup>[564]</sup></a> has had the valuable aid of
old College accounts. Malthus had little besides
Eden, Arthur Young, and the Reports to the Board of
Agriculture; and it is doubtful if he fully understood
the effects on the labourer of Henry VII.’s debasement
of the currency, or could apply the analogy to
the depreciation in his own day.<a id='r565'></a><a href='#f565' class='c016'><sup>[565]</sup></a> But on the whole,
as years went on, he became less physiocratic. He
came to acknowledge that, if a purely agricultural
country might in some cases, like America, be the
best possible for the labourer, it might in other cases,
like Poland or Ireland, be the worst possible for him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>If we hear that the labourer in one country earns
in a year fifteen and in another nine quarters of
wheat, we cannot be sure that the former is the
better off till we know the value of other things in
the country in comparison with wheat. If manufactures
were very dear in comparison, then the
labourer’s wages except in food would go very little
way, unless in a case like America, where the quantity
is so great that it makes up for the little value of corn
wages. In Poland the value of corn is so low, and
there is so little capital in the country, that the high
corn wages mean low real wages, and the population
is either stationary or very slow in its increase. The
prosperity of an agricultural country, then, depends
on other causes than the direction of its attention to
the one industry of agriculture, and without knowing
these we could not infer or predict it.<a id='r566'></a><a href='#f566' class='c016'><sup>[566]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus in fact reached the point at which he was
always glad to arrive, the medium between two
extreme views.<a id='r567'></a><a href='#f567' class='c016'><sup>[567]</sup></a> He would neither approve of a
purely agricultural nation, whose danger was want
of capital, nor of a purely commercial, whose danger
was want of food. In a purely commercial, everything
depends on a superiority in industry, machinery,
and trade, which from the nature of things cannot
last. Not only foreign but domestic competition will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>bring down profits, and thereby, by discouraging
saving and enterprise, diminish the demand for
labour and bring the population to a standstill.
Christendom has seen Venice, Bruges, Holland lose
their trade by their neighbours’ gain.<a id='r568'></a><a href='#f568' class='c016'><sup>[568]</sup></a> To say that
the nations of the world ought to be allowed to
develope their trade as freely as the provinces of a
single empire, is, in his opinion, to overlook the
reality of political obstacles. If England were still
separated into the kingdoms of the Heptarchy,
London could not be what it is. The interest of a
province and the interest of an independent state are
never the same.<a id='r569'></a><a href='#f569' class='c016'><sup>[569]</sup></a> To one who believes political
divisions inevitable, there can be little hope for universal
free trade. Malthus is unable to rise to the
cosmopolitan view of Cobden, and he never seems to
see that by ignoring political barriers, free trade may
really weaken them. His ideal is a state which
combines agriculture and commerce in equal proportions.<a id='r570'></a><a href='#f570' class='c016'><sup>[570]</sup></a>
The prosperity of the latter implies the decay
of feudalism and the establishment of secure government;
with security comes the spontaneous extension
of enterprise and a steady demand for labour. Since
the two great classes of producers provide a market
for each other, wealth will constantly grow, and
without risk of sudden check by a foreign influence.
The prosperity of such a country may (he thinks) last
practically for ever, and we might answer in the
affirmative for our own country the query of Bishop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Berkeley about his.<a id='r571'></a><a href='#f571' class='c016'><sup>[571]</sup></a> “The countries which unite
great landed resources with a prosperous state of
commerce and manufactures, and in which the commercial
part of the population never essentially
exceeds the agricultural part, are eminently secure
from sudden reverses. Their increasing wealth seems
to be out of the reach of all common accidents, and
there is no reason to say that they might not go on
increasing in riches and population for hundreds, nay
almost thousands of years.”<a id='r572'></a><a href='#f572' class='c016'><sup>[572]</sup></a> They would go on in
fact till they reached the extreme practical limits of
population, which under the system of private property
would mean such a state of the land as would “enable
the last employed labourers to produce the maintenance
of as many probably as four persons,” the man,
his wife, and two children. As soon as the labour
ceases to produce more than this, it ceases to be
worth the employer’s while to give the wages and
employ the labour. These practical limits are far
from the limits of the earth’s power to produce food,
and a Government which compelled every member
of society to devote himself wholly to the raising of
food and necessaries, would succeed in coming nearer
to those farther limits, though at the expense of
everything we mean by civilization.<a id='r573'></a><a href='#f573' class='c016'><sup>[573]</sup></a> As a matter
of fact, even the practical limit is not approached
by way of a uniform decline of profits and of
population. Various causes, acting at irregular intervals,
stave off the event. The decline of general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>profits, the introduction of long leases and large
farming, would bring more capital to the land;
improvements in agriculture will increase the produce,
inventions in manufacture will lessen the cost of the
agriculturist’s comforts, and make his wages and
profits go farther; the opening of a foreign market
may raise home prices; a temporary rise in the value
of agricultural produce may stimulate the investment
of capital in farming. So Malthus concludes, for
reasons not unlike Cliffe Leslie’s,<a id='r574'></a><a href='#f574' class='c016'><sup>[574]</sup></a> that, though there
is a tendency of profits to fall, yet the tendency is
often defeated. Though there is much truth still in
many of his statements, the conclusion he draws from
them,<a id='r575'></a><a href='#f575' class='c016'><sup>[575]</sup></a> that we ought by a judicious system of corn
duties and corn bounties to keep the price of food
steady and secure a large home supply, is quite out
of court now. The variations in price have been
under free trade very moderate; and the supply from
one quarter or another has never failed us. Free
trade is no longer among our problems.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be added, however, that there is no reason
why the “practical limits” should not exist under
a paternal or fraternal socialism as well as under
the present social system. Even if industry were
initiated and directed not by individuals but socialistically
by Government, the sole motive need not be
to increase the mere numbers of the people, and
therefore the mere total quantity of food needed for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>a bare life. The motive of socialistic government
would be to secure a high degree of comfort, not a
bare subsistence, for all; and therefore, at the cost of
a limitation of numbers, society would still remain at
a distance from its greatest possible production of
food. Whether such a limitation of numbers is
likely to take place in the reconstituted society is
discussed elsewhere.<a id='r576'></a><a href='#f576' class='c016'><sup>[576]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>As the Rent and Corn pamphlets deal chiefly with
Mother Earth, the tract on the Measure of Value<a id='r577'></a><a href='#f577' class='c016'><sup>[577]</sup></a>
deals chiefly with Father Work. The search for a
common measure of value is not, to Malthus, a
purely academical problem. He considers such a
measure desirable because in any inquiry into the
wealth of nations it is important to distinguish
between the rise of one commodity and the fall of
another. The former is an intrinsic alteration of
value which will affect every exchange in which the
object is concerned; the latter an extrinsic which
affects only the one exchange, of the object in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>question with the foreign object that has been
altered. By value of course is to be understood
economic value, or “the power of commanding other
objects in exchange,” not value in the (not uncommon)
wider sense, of usefulness in supplying wants.<a id='r578'></a><a href='#f578' class='c016'><sup>[578]</sup></a> The
economic value of anything, taken in relation to some
object which never changes its value from intrinsic
causes, may be called the “natural or absolute value”
of that thing, and the object with which it was
compared may be called the “measure” of absolute or
natural value, in other words, of the value which a
thing must fetch if its supply is to be continued.
While not only money but any and every object may
be such a measure of value for a limited place and
time, even money itself is not a good measure for
widely different places or for long periods of time;
and corn, which is better for long periods, is worse
for short.</p>

<p class='c007'>Labour is better than either, but Labour is ambiguous.
We may measure the value of anything
either by the labour it has cost us in the making of it,
which gives us Ricardo’s sense of natural value, or by
the labour it will purchase after it is made. Adam
Smith,<a id='r579'></a><a href='#f579' class='c016'><sup>[579]</sup></a> who preferred labour both to money and
corn as the measure of value, wavered between these
two meanings of the terms. Malthus declares at
once against the first sense. Labour, he says, in the
sense of cost does not altogether determine value and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>therefore cannot measure it, even for similar places
and times. In 1820 Malthus had been of opinion
that a mean between corn and labour was a better
measure of value than labour itself; but since 1823
he recurred to the view of Adam Smith,<a id='r580'></a><a href='#f580' class='c016'><sup>[580]</sup></a> and held
that the amount of the unskilled common day labour
of the agricultural labourer, which a thing will
purchase or command, is a good measure of the value
of it even at widely different places and times.
“Agricultural labour is taken for the obvious reasons
that it is the commonest species of labour, that it
directly produces the food of the labourer, and that
it is the most immediately connected with the gradations
of soil and the necessary variations of profits.
It is also assumed with Adam Smith, Mr. Ricardo,
and other political economists, that, on an average,
other kinds of labour continue to bear the same
proportions to agricultural labour.”<a id='r581'></a><a href='#f581' class='c016'><sup>[581]</sup></a> The bodily
exertion of the labourer does not change; it is the
same sweat of the brow, the same sacrifice of physical
force. When corn, for example, will command a
less amount of labour than it would have done a
century before, we may be sure it is because of a
change not in the labour but in the corn; and we
ought therefore to say not that labour has risen in
value, but that corn has fallen. Malthus’ search for a
permanent element in the changeable has led him to
individual human labour as the economical unit. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>the Chinese labourer has lower wages than the
English, it is not because his labour is of lower value,
but because his necessaries are of higher. Wages are
higher in the United States not because labour is of
higher value, but because necessaries are of lower.<a id='r582'></a><a href='#f582' class='c016'><sup>[582]</sup></a>
Of course when skill enters into the labour, the unit
is not the same; but, when we look only at unskilled,
we find confirmation of Malthus’ view in the experience
of the elder and the younger Brassey as
employers of labour, that quantity for quantity “the
cost of the labour [the expense of it to the employer]
is the same everywhere” over the world.<a id='r583'></a><a href='#f583' class='c016'><sup>[583]</sup></a> The
measure, however, is by no means out of court as
regards skilled labour; the difference in kind may
be stated in terms of a difference in degree. If the
watchmaker’s labour be paid at the rate of 10<em>s.</em> a
day, and the common agricultural labourer’s only
at 1<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em>, the former may be stated as equivalent to
six days’ common labour.<a id='r584'></a><a href='#f584' class='c016'><sup>[584]</sup></a> Malthus has in his mind
a scale of compensation such as is drawn out by
Adam Smith in the tenth chapter of the first book
of the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>.<a id='r585'></a><a href='#f585' class='c016'><sup>[585]</sup></a> Disagreeableness, difficulty,
inconstancy, responsibility, risk of failure, are
so many disabilities, for each of which a compensation
must be made to the workman in the scale of
his wages, as adding in effect so many more hours’
labour; and each higher class of workman must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>paid the unit of common labourer’s wages, with the
compensations superadded. In practice this means
that men will not be found in sufficient numbers to
do the higher class work unless the wages are sufficient
to make it worth their while to undergo the
disabilities. It is assumed that this scale has been
adjusted by custom and the “higgling of the market”
from generation to generation, till in any given
neighbourhood each of the several skilled trades has a
definitely recognized place in the series.<a id='r586'></a><a href='#f586' class='c016'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This reasoning seems less convincing when we
consider that the translation of skill into terms of
hours would be different in different localities, and
that the common labour, which is the unit, would
vary in the same way. The measure of value would
hold only for a given place, time, and people. To
escape from the difficulty, we must consider the
difference between the common labour at one time
and place and the common labour at another as itself
measurable, and allow for it; or else we must consider
it as too small to disturb our conclusions, and so neglect
it altogether. To reduce common labour to its theoretically
simplest terms is to reduce it to something
below our experience; and to reduce it to its actually
simplest in the given cases is to reduce it to one thing
in England, a second in France, a third in India, a
fourth in America. There are differences of quality
which cannot be with any certainty resolved into
differences of quantity; such are the differences of
individuals, the differences of nations, the differences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>of races. It will be found, also, that the part played
by common as opposed to skilled labour, and by agricultural
as opposed to manufacturing labour, differs
so much between country and country that, in order
to use labour as a measure, we should need other
measures in addition to it. In short, if we had data
enough to apply this measure, we should have data
enough to dispense with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was possibly the force of these considerations
that led Malthus, as time went on, to approach somewhat
nearer to Ricardo, whose measure, so far as he
had one, was not the labour purchased but the labour
that entered into cost. But he adhered to the substance
of his doctrine as expressed in the tract; and
his positions, in detail, were as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The power of one object to command another in
exchange is influenced either by a change in the
object itself, or by a change in the other. If we
found a case where there was never a change in the
first object itself, then we should have, in that first,
a measure of natural or absolute as opposed to
nominal or relative value, <em>i. e.</em> a measure of that
value of an article which satisfies the “conditions of
the supply” of it, and enables its production to be
continued without loss to the producers. By “conditions
of supply” is meant Ricardo’s “cost of
production” with the addition of ordinary profits.
No measure of market or relative values is possible;
and to have a measure of natural value itself we must
make two postulates,—that natural value depends
on “labour and profits” (<em>sic</em>), on rent little if at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>all, and that the “wages” of labour are also the
“value” of labour,—what labour is paid is also what
labour will fetch. It is easy to apply the measure
where <em>only</em> labour is concerned, for then the labour
that the things <em>cost</em> is a sufficient measure; it would
be evident, at any change, that the things had become
cheaper, not the labour dearer. But in present
society value is more complicated; labour is no doubt
the chief source of it, but profits are a very considerable
one.<a id='r587'></a><a href='#f587' class='c016'><sup>[587]</sup></a> The natural conditions of supply, however,
may be stated in terms of labour, just as if labour
had been the sole ingredient. This would give us
a measure for the <em>same</em> country at the same place
and time. The total quantity of labour that an article
cost, with the addition of ordinary profits stated in
terms of labour, would be the same as that quantity
of labour which an article would purchase in its
natural value.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of <em>different</em> countries, at the same time,
the difficulties are not quite the same. Exchange is
there determined not by labour but by money prices;
and money is of very different value in the one
country and in the other. But the differences in the
value of money in different countries are in proportion
to the different prices of agricultural labour—1500
days’ labour at 4<em>d.</em> a day in India, at 2<em>s.</em> in England,
meaning £25 and £150 respectively; and, if fixed
capital to the value of 300 days’ labour were advanced
to each of them, while profits calculated in days’
labour were twenty per cent. in the one case, ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>in the other, the result would be an article whose
conditions of supply would require in the one case a
money price of £31, in the other of £168. The
difference is no doubt due to the superior efficiency
of English industry and skill which enables England
to purchase the precious metals more cheaply,<a id='r588'></a><a href='#f588' class='c016'><sup>[588]</sup></a> but
the cost of getting the money would not tell us
the true present value of the money in England or in
India. It is not the labour spent on the gold, but
the labour purchased by it, that will help us here.
In each country within itself we would measure the
natural value of money as well as of anything else
by what labour it will purchase; know the difference
between the value of money in the one and its value
in the other by the difference between the amount
of labour it will purchase in the one case and the
amount it will purchase in the other.<a id='r589'></a><a href='#f589' class='c016'><sup>[589]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of <em>different periods in the same country</em>,
though we have not, as in the case of two different
countries, the test of an actual exchange, we can
still use labour as the measure. We must allow
for the higher profits of the earlier period; and
on the (Ricardian) principle that profits and wages
vary inversely, though corn wages have risen,
profits have in proportion fallen, and the total
value of the produce measured by its power of purchasing
labour must be the same,<a id='r590'></a><a href='#f590' class='c016'><sup>[590]</sup></a> the purchased
labour then representing the producing labour plus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the then rate of profits. From Ricardo’s dogma it
seems (to Malthus) to follow directly that the value
of labour is constant.<a id='r591'></a><a href='#f591' class='c016'><sup>[591]</sup></a> Taking the labour they will
purchase as the best measure of the value of the
precious metals, as of anything else, we have light
on one of the pressing questions of the day (in 1823),
the causes of the changing value of money. The
causes affect not the labour but the money, and they
are of two kinds. The first Malthus describes as a
primary or necessary cause, namely, the variation in
profits depending on the (Ricardian) theory of the interlocking
of wages and profits, and the (Malthusian)
theory of the relation of profits to rent. Dear corn
due to difficult cultivation would lower profits, and
would alter the value of money, but only in relation
to raw, not in relation to manufactured produce, or
at least (from the effects of Ricardo’s principle of the
inverse variation of wages and profits) not to the same
extent. But the second, which is a “secondary
and incidental” class of causes, affects both raw and
manufactured goods, and is often enough to completely
dwarf the effects of the primary cause;<a id='r592'></a><a href='#f592' class='c016'><sup>[592]</sup></a>—it is the
general commercial situation of a country,—“the
fertility and vicinity of the mines, the different
efficiency of labour in different countries, the abundance
or scarcity of exportable commodities, and the
state of the demand and supply of commodities and
labour compared with” the precious metals.<a id='r593'></a><a href='#f593' class='c016'><sup>[593]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>efficiency of labour and a prosperous commerce, with
a great consequent demand for corn and labour,
are often more powerful in making bullion cheap
than agricultural productiveness and high profits in
making bullion dear and corn cheap. During the
war—say from 1790 to 1814—we had an instance of
this, and since the war—say from 1814 to 1823—we
have had a clear instance, he thinks, of the
converse.<a id='r594'></a><a href='#f594' class='c016'><sup>[594]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Two elaborate papers on the measure of value,
written in 1825 and 1827, show that Malthus was
becoming inclined to make less of his differences with
Ricardo.<a id='r595'></a><a href='#f595' class='c016'><sup>[595]</sup></a> They were intimate friends; their discussions
had no bitterness; and, to use the words of
one of them, “both were so anxious for the truth that
sooner or later they would have agreed.”<a id='r596'></a><a href='#f596' class='c016'><sup>[596]</sup></a> These
papers are a fulfilment of his duty not (as we might
guess) as a fellow of the Royal Society or a member
of the Political Economy Club,<a id='r597'></a><a href='#f597' class='c016'><sup>[597]</sup></a> but as an associate
of the Royal Society of Literature.<a id='r598'></a><a href='#f598' class='c016'><sup>[598]</sup></a> “That branch of
literature” [<em>sic</em>] “on which it shall be his duty to
communicate with the Society once a year at least”
is described as “political economy and statistics.”<a id='r599'></a><a href='#f599' class='c016'><sup>[599]</sup></a>
He does little credit in these papers to his literary
faculty. Their composition is laboured and devoid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>of ornament. The first is <cite>On the Measure of the
Conditions necessary to the Supply of Commodities</cite>; and
the thesis is, that “the natural and necessary conditions
of the supply of all commodities,” that are
not monopolies, are represented and measured by
the labour which they will on an average command,
and by nothing else. The second is <cite>On the Meaning
which is most usually and most correctly attached to
the term, Value of Commodities</cite>; and the thesis is, that,
when value is used without a qualifying adjective or
reference to any special equivalent in a possible exchange,<a id='r600'></a><a href='#f600' class='c016'><sup>[600]</sup></a>
the term refers to the “conditions of supply.”
When we say, for example, anything is sold at a price
far above its true value, we mean far above its cost
price, including under “cost” the average rate of profits
that must go to the maker if he is to live by his
trade. The two papers taken together form a sort of
indirect proof of the position taken up in the tract
on the <cite>Measure of Value</cite> (1823), and the relevant
parts of the second edition of the <cite>Political Economy</cite>
(1836), and may be stated briefly thus:—The labour
commanded by an article is generally the measure
of that article’s cost;—but that article’s cost is
what people generally mean by its value;—therefore
the labour commanded by an article is the measure
of that article’s value in the ordinary sense of the
word.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second paper was written at the same time as
the <cite>Definitions in Political Economy</cite>, and illustrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>the rule laid down there, prescribing adherence, when
possible, to the meaning which economical terms bear
in the mouths of ordinary folk.<a id='r601'></a><a href='#f601' class='c016'><sup>[601]</sup></a> The <cite>Definitions</cite>, for
example, repeat from (or with) the second paper,
“when no second object is specified, the value of
the commodity naturally refers to the causes” which
determine “the estimation in which it is held” “and
the object which measures it.”<a id='r602'></a><a href='#f602' class='c016'><sup>[602]</sup></a>  “The natural value
of a commodity at any place and time” is “the
estimation in which it is held when it is in its
natural and ordinary state,” as “determined by the
elementary costs of its production,” or in other words,
by “the conditions of its supply.” And the measure
of the natural value of a commodity at any place
and time is “the quantity of labour for which it will
exchange at that place and time when it is in its
natural and ordinary state.”<a id='r603'></a><a href='#f603' class='c016'><sup>[603]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As a literary production the book written for the
public is superior to the papers prepared for the men
of letters. Next to the first <cite>Essay on Population</cite>, the
critical parts of the <cite>Definitions</cite> give the most pleasant
examples of the author’s style. The two papers
above mentioned are chiefly important as showing the
importance which Malthus, unlike Ricardo, attached to
the question of a measure of value.<a id='r604'></a><a href='#f604' class='c016'><sup>[604]</sup></a> A contemporary
writer said very happily that the fault of Ricardo was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>to generalize too much, and of Malthus to generalize
too little. Malthus, he added, is a keen observer
but poor in analysis; he is “so occupied with particulars
that he neglects that inductive process which
extends individual experience throughout the infinitude
of things,” and converts knowledge into science.
“As presented by Mr. Ricardo, political economy
possesses a regularity and simplicity beyond what
exists in nature; as exhibited by Mr. Malthus, it is a
chaos of original but unconnected elements.”<a id='r605'></a><a href='#f605' class='c016'><sup>[605]</sup></a> On the
other hand, the testimony of a recent German writer
is very different. Malthus, he tells us, resembles
Ricardo in his sombre view of human life and frank
statement of unpleasant facts. Their names are
often associated, and no doubt both are children of
their times. But their leanings were really unlike.
Ricardo took up certain ideas of his time in their
narrowest, clearest, and harshest form, and applied
them wholly in the interest of capital. Malthus is
far less narrow. His influence on economics has been
much smaller than Ricardo’s; but he will be found
“by far the more suggestive and less prejudiced of
the two,” and, if he found more opponents, it
is because he was less understood and less read.<a id='r606'></a><a href='#f606' class='c016'><sup>[606]</sup></a>
The sprightly <cite>Dialogues</cite><a id='r607'></a><a href='#f607' class='c016'><sup>[607]</sup></a> of De Quincey contribute
nothing to the discussion on value; but they show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>how completely Ricardo had won the ear of the
literary world, and how little pains the opponents of
Malthus took to do him justice. Malthus reduced
the problem to many elements; Ricardo to few;
and the latter, as certainly easier to understand,
was readily represented as the likelier to be true.
Simplicity in such a case is a treacherous virtue; and
the apparent chaos may have been much nearer the
truth than the apparent cosmos, if there was a hidden
flaw in the latter and a latent principle of union
in the former. Sound or unsound, such a principle
may be traced in the most abstract discussions of
Malthus. We shall find this true when we compare
his views with Ricardo’s on the nature and causes
of value itself, and the movements of prices. We
may recognize it even in these discussions on the
measure of value. The measurement of all value
by individual human labour is of a piece with the
author’s final view of population, where all is made to
depend on individual responsibility.<a id='r608'></a><a href='#f608' class='c016'><sup>[608]</sup></a> The main weakness
of the position is perhaps that by unskilled
labour he means always agricultural, and does not
sufficiently recognize how in manufacturing England
it has perhaps become easier to measure unskilled by
skilled than the latter by the former. The difficulty
met Robert Owen, when in his <cite>Labour Exchanges</cite><a id='r609'></a><a href='#f609' class='c016'><sup>[609]</sup></a> he
not only tried to reduce all values to a common
measure in labour, but to make labour a means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>exchange, for which it is certainly worse suited than
money.</p>

<p class='c007'>Labour as something to be rewarded by Wages has
a more evident connection with the principles of the
<cite>Essay on Population</cite> than labour as the measure of
all values. In this case unskilled agricultural labour
is again the unit. The first “condition of the
supply” of this labour is the necessaries of life, in
such quantities as will enable the labourers to maintain
their numbers or to increase them,<a id='r610'></a><a href='#f610' class='c016'><sup>[610]</sup></a> as the case
may be. If the former only, the price of labour is
not, as Ricardo says, the “natural,” but really a most
unnatural price, for it would mean that the country
giving it had arrived at the final limit of its resources.<a id='r611'></a><a href='#f611' class='c016'><sup>[611]</sup></a>
Necessaries, however, are not a simple or even a
fixed element. We can of course measure them in
corn if we like; but they consist not only of the
prime necessary, the staff of life, but of other absolute
necessaries, of shelter and clothing, and many “conveniences”
which have become necessaries, inasmuch
as they are essential to healthy life, such as soap and
shoes and candle-light. It has happily become a
truism that the necessaries of life are not a fixed but
an expanding factor. Even if competition were
always to drive wages down to a “minimum of social
necessaries,”<a id='r612'></a><a href='#f612' class='c016'><sup>[612]</sup></a> social are always beyond animal necessaries;
our basest beggars are in the poorest thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>superfluous; and “the barest social necessaries” seem
likely in process of time to mean a high standard of
comfort. To raise the minimum of social necessaries
is the way to raise wages really, universally, and
almost irrevocably.<a id='r613'></a><a href='#f613' class='c016'><sup>[613]</sup></a> Malthus himself declares that
“it is the diffusion of luxury” in this sense of the
word, “among the mass of the people, and not an
excess of it in a few,” that seems to be advantageous,
both for national wealth and national happiness.
Paley’s ideal of national prosperity, “a laborious
frugal people ministering to the demands of an
opulent luxurious nation,” is heartily scouted by him.
The luxuries of the few rich, he says, harass the
industry of the poor by varying with the fashion;
but the luxuries of the poor, when embodied in their
general standard of living, are not only the best kind
of check to population, but the steadiest encouragement
to general trade.<a id='r614'></a><a href='#f614' class='c016'><sup>[614]</sup></a> He seems to have supposed
the elevation in the standard of living to have been
effected, like the progress of nations in civilization, by
the happy improvement of an accidental advantage,
by the retention of high wages, when once secured
in a time of brisk trade in the ordinary way of competition;
the workmen, in short, succeeded in making
permanent and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de jure</span></i> a change once <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de facto</span></i> for the
time effected.<a id='r615'></a><a href='#f615' class='c016'><sup>[615]</sup></a> “When our wages of labour in wheat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>were high in the early part of the last century, it did
not appear that they were employed merely in the
maintenance of more families, but in improving the
condition of the people in their general mode of
living.”<a id='r616'></a><a href='#f616' class='c016'><sup>[616]</sup></a> Malthus, without knowing it, was certainly
father of the theory of a Wages Fund. The theory
is that the average wages of the labouring classes at
any given time are high or low in proportion to the
great or small amount of circulating capital devoted
to the payment of wages, or, as it is sometimes
expressed (more tersely and inexactly), wages depend
on “the ratio of population to capital.” This might
mean no more than the arithmetical truism that we
may always find the average wages by dividing the
total sum received by the total number of recipients;
and the quotient would be unalterable only in the
sense in which all other facts might be said to be
so, in retrospect. But it is usually taken to mean
that the first total could not at any given time have
been greater or less than it actually was, being fixed
unalterably by circumstances,<a id='r617'></a><a href='#f617' class='c016'><sup>[617]</sup></a> and so “devoted” or
“determined” to the payment of wages. The simplest
test of this theory is the application of it to the case
of a single individual capitalist and his payments in
wages. Suppose he has a capital of £10,000, £5000
fixed and £5000 circulating; and suppose that the
latter means wages only (instead of chiefly), and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>paid to one hundred men;—£50 a year will be the
average wages of the hundred men; and, by the
theory, given the rate of ordinary profits and given
the “desire of accumulation” at the time and place,
it could not possibly have been either more or less.
But, as the profits are not unconditional, neither are
the wages; the capitalist might conceivably, to save
his business, keep it up in bad times at a loss, and
pay wages at the expense of profits and at the expense
of his personal pleasures.<a id='r618'></a><a href='#f618' class='c016'><sup>[618]</sup></a> He has often the choice
before him to spend more on fixtures, or more on
new hands, or more on further employment of the
old hands. In truth, too, though wages, especially
in England, are often in the first instance advanced
out of capital, they are always meant to be paid out
of the gross returns, and in every sound business
really are so. The workman and employer make
their contract beforehand, and expect each other to
abide by it, be the profit much or little; the wages
depend, therefore, directly on this contract, and indirectly
on that which is the means of fulfilling the
contract on the master’s side, the price of the article
made. The price of the article is the real wages
fund;<a id='r619'></a><a href='#f619' class='c016'><sup>[619]</sup></a> and therefore the wages fund must be as
flexible as market prices, and the actual wages as
changeable as are the powers, habits, and desires of
the two contracting parties.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>The theory of a wages fund was formed from the
facts of a perfectly exceptional time, and on the
strength of two truths misapplied, the doctrine of
Malthus (on Population) in its most unripe form,
and of Ricardo (on Value) in its most abstract.
J. R. MacCulloch seems to have been the first who
put the two together to deduce a rigid law of wages.
“The market rate of wages,” he says, “is exclusively
dependent on the proportion which the capital of the
country, or the means of employing labour, bears to
the number of labourers. There is plainly, therefore,
only one way of really improving the condition of
the great majority of the community or of the labouring
class, and that is by increasing the ratio of capital
to population,” which the labourers for their part can
only do by diminishing the supply of labour.<a id='r620'></a><a href='#f620' class='c016'><sup>[620]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Even Mrs. Marcet, a docile Ricardian, had put the
case more carefully. “<em>Work</em> to be performed is the
immediate cause of the demand for labour; but, however
great or important is the work which a man
may wish to undertake, the execution of it must
always be limited by the extent of his capital, <em>i. e.</em>
by the funds he possesses for the maintenance or
payment of his labourers.”<a id='r621'></a><a href='#f621' class='c016'><sup>[621]</sup></a> She professes to be
expounding the received doctrine of her day. MacCulloch’s
exposition is much more rigid. When he
speaks of the “funds devoted to the payment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>wages,” he means “that portion of the capital or
wealth of a country which the employers of labour
<em>intend</em> or <em>are willing</em> to lay out in the purchase of
labour.” It “may be larger at one time than at
another. But, whatever be its magnitude, it obviously
forms the only source from which any portion of the
wages of labour can be derived. No other fund is
in existence from which the labourers as such can
draw a single shilling. And hence it follows that
the average rate of wages or the share of the national
capital appropriated to the employment of labour
falling, at an average, to each labourer, must entirely
depend on its amount as compared with the number
of those amongst whom it has to be divided.”<a id='r622'></a><a href='#f622' class='c016'><sup>[622]</sup></a>
Neither MacCulloch, nor James Mill, nor John Mill
in his early writings, nor apparently any of the expounders
of the theory, were in the habit of describing
the fund as “unconditionally” devoted to the
payment of wages, though John Mill, in restating
the position after he abandoned it, gives us so to
understand.<a id='r623'></a><a href='#f623' class='c016'><sup>[623]</sup></a> Something like unconditional determination,
however, is assumed in all the reasonings
of the school. Adam Smith’s frequent use of the
words “funds devoted” or “funds determined” to
this or that purpose may easily have been misunderstood.
Certainly in his pages they mean no inflexible
compulsion. He says the demand of those who live
by wages can only increase in proportion to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>increase of the “funds” which are “destined” for
the payment of wages, these funds being (he adds)
either the surplus revenue of an idle monied man
who will “naturally” use any addition to them in
increasing his staff of domestic servants, or the
increased capital of the capitalist who will just as
“naturally” use them in employing more workmen.<a id='r624'></a><a href='#f624' class='c016'><sup>[624]</sup></a>
The word “destined” is so far, with him, from
implying any iron necessity that it means simply
“intended”; and the intention is one that can be
foiled or altered. He speaks of the “funds destined
for the consumption” of the manufacturing class,<a id='r625'></a><a href='#f625' class='c016'><sup>[625]</sup></a>
and of the townsfolk’s “fund of subsistence,”<a id='r626'></a><a href='#f626' class='c016'><sup>[626]</sup></a> meaning
simply their food; he even speaks of the funds
destined for the repair of the high roads in France.<a id='r627'></a><a href='#f627' class='c016'><sup>[627]</sup></a>
Even the strong passage in Book I. chap. viii., “the
demand for those who live by wages necessarily
increases with the increase of the revenue and stock
of every country, and cannot possibly increase without
it,” stops considerably short of the doctrine of a
rigid wages fund. It is never suggested by Adam
Smith that the wages fund is inelastic, and that wages
could not at any given time have been greater or
less than they actually were. The doctrine is seldom
traced further back than to Malthus; and Malthus
cannot be shown to have held the doctrine. With
express reference to the passage last cited from the
<cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, he says that “it will be found
that the funds for the maintenance of labour do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>necessarily increase with the increase of wealth, and
very rarely increase in proportion to it, and that
the condition of the lower classes of society does
not depend exclusively upon the increase of the funds
for the maintenance of labour or the power of supporting
a greater number of labourers” (<cite>Essay</cite>, 7th ed.,
III. xiii. 368). The condition of the working classes
depended, he thought, partly on the rate at which the
“funds for the maintenance of labour,”<a id='r628'></a><a href='#f628' class='c016'><sup>[628]</sup></a> or, as he
expressed it at first, “<em>the resources of the country</em>”<a id='r629'></a><a href='#f629' class='c016'><sup>[629]</sup></a>
and the demand for labour are increasing, and partly
on the “habits of the people.” Among their habits
we should need to put their education and their
power of union among themselves, and consequent
strength in a struggle with the masters, to obtain
or to raise the market rate of wages. From Ricardo
he differed on the subject of wages very much as
on the subject of value. Ricardo looked at cost
price as the natural value of an article, and mere
subsistence as the natural wages of labour. Malthus
could do neither.</p>

<p class='c007'>The issues between the two economists are nowhere
so well or so calmly stated as in a paper written by
Malthus (a few months after Ricardo’s death) in the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>,<a id='r630'></a><a href='#f630' class='c016'><sup>[630]</sup></a> where he deals with MacCulloch’s
treatise on <cite>Political Economy</cite>.<a id='r631'></a><a href='#f631' class='c016'><sup>[631]</sup></a> In that article Malthus
professes to regard the political economy of Ricardo,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>James Mill, and most of the economical writers in the
<cite>Encyclopædia</cite>, as a new and wrong departure. It is
said to have been regarded by the writer as one of the
best economical papers he ever wrote;<a id='r632'></a><a href='#f632' class='c016'><sup>[632]</sup></a> and, among
other virtues, it has the merit of perfect courtesy and
respect towards the persons criticized. Their system,
he says,<a id='r633'></a><a href='#f633' class='c016'><sup>[633]</sup></a> is remarkably like that of the French
economists. They “were equally men of the most
unquestionable genius, of the highest honour and
integrity, and of the most simple, modest, and amiable
manners. Their systems were equally distinguished
for their discordance with common notions, the
apparent closeness of their reasonings, and the mathematical
precision of their calculations and conclusions
founded on their assumed data. These qualities in
the systems and their founders, together with the
desire so often felt by readers of moderate abilities
of being thought to understand what is considered by
competent judges as difficult, increased the number
of their devoted followers in such a degree, that in
France it included almost all the able men who were
inclined to attend to such subjects, and in England a
very large proportion of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The specific error of the French economists was
the having taken so confined a view of wealth and its
sources as not to include the results of manufacturing
and mercantile industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The specific error of the new school in England is
the having taken so confined a view of <em>value</em> as not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>include the results of demand and supply, and of the
relative abundance and competition of capital.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Facts and experience have, in the course of some
years, gradually converted the economists of France
from the erroneous and inapplicable theory of Quesnay
to the juster and more practical theory of Adam
Smith; and, as we are fully convinced that an error
equally fundamental and important is involved in the
system of the new school in England as in that of the
French economists, we cannot but hope and expect
that similar causes will, in time, produce in our own
country similar effects in the correction of error and
the establishment of truth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The new school has, according to Malthus, three
main principles. The first is, that what determines
value is the quantity of labour that a thing costs
to make,—the second, that supply and demand do
not as a rule affect values,—and the third, that
fertility of soil and not competition regulates the
rate of profits. The new school thinks that profits
enter so little into the price of an article that they
may be neglected altogether in the computation of
the causes of value. But (says Malthus) the value
of a stone wall would be due, nearly all of it, to
labour, and the value of a cask of old wine kept for
twenty or thirty years would be largely due to
profits. £50 worth of stone wall would have much
more labour “worked up in it” than £50 worth of
old wine. It is not sufficient to answer that profits
are simply accumulated wages. As well say that
five is another name for four. Ricardo himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>introduced many qualifications into his own statement
that value is due to labour. The principle (he
confessed) was modified by the use of machinery
and by the unequal durability of capital.<a id='r634'></a><a href='#f634' class='c016'><sup>[634]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus admits the truth of Ricardo’s dogma that
profits and wages can only increase at each other’s
expense, and he even applies this principle of
Ricardo’s in a new way to the facts of the commercial
depression that had prevailed since the peace.<a id='r635'></a><a href='#f635' class='c016'><sup>[635]</sup></a>
It was universally allowed there had been a less
demand for labour and a great fall in wages, but,
it was also allowed, a much greater fall in profits;
so that wages while lower in gross amount bore a
higher proportion to profits than before. The reason
was that, while the competition of labourers was
great, the competition of capitalists with capitalists
was still greater. The result was a universal fall of
prices; the wages, though relatively greater, were
absolutely less in amount, and the demand for labour
would have been greater if prices had risen and the
capitalist had got greater returns to his capital.
Malthus would not go farther than this, and the
Ricardian doctrine needs to be otherwise applied to
yield the doctrine of a wages fund. It was applied
in some such way as follows:—Competition drives
prices down to the cost of production; this means
that at any given time the sum total of profits and
wages cannot be more than they actually are, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>both are kept down by competition to their minimum;
the masters could not give higher wages
without cutting down their profits, the men could
not get less wages without either starving or being
driven to seek other employments. Malthus does
not so apply his doctrines. To him, what fixes the
sum total of wages and profits is not the cost of
production, but the demand for the thing produced;
not the labour spent on a thing, but the labour that
others are willing to give for it; and the cause of
value is not cost, but demand acting with supply.
Ricardo, who prefers to confine his theories to natural
value, allows that the state of the demand and supply
raises market value above or depresses it below cost
price; and he does not see how seriously his own
qualifications<a id='r636'></a><a href='#f636' class='c016'><sup>[636]</sup></a> impair the truth of his theory of
value even when the value is “natural.”<a id='r637'></a><a href='#f637' class='c016'><sup>[637]</sup></a> It is true,
on the other hand, that the supply at any given time
is a supply that will not be kept up unless the cost
price be paid back. The cost price would certainly
be the minimum below which prices could not permanently
pass. But to Ricardo the cost in labour is
the formal as well as the material cause of a value;
to Malthus it is only the material, and only part of
that, a mere <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</span></i>, while the efficient is the
demand, and the final is the consumption of the article
by its last buyer or user.</p>

<p class='c007'>The third leading tenet of the new school, says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Malthus, is that the rate of profits in a country
depends on the fertility of the soil there, and not,
as Adam Smith thought, on the competition of
capital with capital for employment. Against them
Malthus maintains that there is no necessary (though
there is a frequent) connection between the productiveness
of industry and the rate of profits,
still less between the latter and the productiveness
of any one single industry, such as agriculture.
Profits depend on the proportion of the whole produce
which “goes to replace the advances of the
capitalist”; but this proportion may remain the
same when the productiveness of industry is very
various. In the previous eight or nine years, say
from 1815 to 1824, there had certainly been no
costliness in production. Corn had been cheap, and
farmers’ losses had led to the discontinuance of
high farming, and especially of the forced cultivation
of the dear years. The production, therefore, was at
the cost of much less labour. But profits, instead of
higher, were much lower. Abundance of produce
and competition of producers had caused a fall in
the value of produce, so that it was possible for
the labourer to receive a greater share of what he
made, though his labour had not become more productive.
Ricardo does not take sufficient account
of the influence of prices, both on wages and on
profits.</p>

<p class='c007'>There had in fact been over-production and a
general glut. James Mill’s <cite>Elements of Political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Economy</cite><a id='r638'></a><a href='#f638' class='c016'><sup>[638]</sup></a> contain a careful demonstration that
general gluts are impossible. It was emphatically
a controversial passage, and in the pages of John
Mill it has the look of an anachronism. All depended
on the meaning of “general.” If it meant
universal, the case was impossible. It is incredible
that all without exception should have something to
sell and no wish to buy. To offer anything for
sale must of itself imply a desire to buy something
else with it, either directly or by means of money.
Even a very near approach to universality is not easy
to understand; and it would mean simply that a bad
organization of the world’s markets had prevented
buyers and sellers from reaching each other, and prevented
goods from going where they are wanted, at
the time when they are wanted; it would mean that
not the malady but the scale and degree of it had
passed belief.<a id='r639'></a><a href='#f639' class='c016'><sup>[639]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c015'>French War and English Trade—English Currency—Bullion Committee—Restriction
not the only Cause of High Prices—Ricardo on
Currency—Tooke on Prices—Say on Gluts—English Trade from
1824—High and Low Wages—Some Fallacies of Malthus.</p>

<p class='c006'>The discussion on General Gluts was simply a phase
of the discussions on Value; and the prominence of
such discussions in the political economy of sixty
years ago was largely due to the peculiar effects on
trade and prices of a twenty years’ war with France.
The theories of economists were becoming most
abstract precisely at the time when the justest generalizations
were most severely tested by abnormal conditions.
Even if the Industrial Revolution heralded
by the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> had been allowed a free
course, the new conditions of manufacture would have
raised new economical questions; and they could not
have failed to turn, to some extent, on the subject
of value, which Adam Smith had by no means exhausted.
But there was no free course. War was
declared against England by France in 1793. In
the same year Pitt was forced to offer English merchants
a loan of public money, to cure a financial crisis.
Then followed, under the long Tory supremacy, heavy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>taxes, repressive laws, and something more nearly
approaching a war of classes than anything known
in England before or since.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effects of the first ten years of the French
war (1793 to 1802) were to all appearance rather
good than bad. Britain itself, unlike the other
belligerent countries, was always intact, and the
labours of British manufacturers could go on as if
nothing unusual was happening on the Continent.
Our command of the sea, to say nothing of the
conquest of new countries, gave us trade which
others lost, and made amends for the annulment of
the French treaty of commerce, and the loss of the
Dutch trade. In 1806 the situation became less
pleasant. The Berlin and Milan decrees excluding
us from almost every country in Europe, the retaliatory
Orders in Council and consequent alienation of
America did real damage to English commerce. The
very expectations they caused of a probable scarcity
of particular goods sent up prices; and, with the
real scarcity, contributed to an acute disturbance of
trade, which lasted about five years for the Continent
and three years more for America (1807–12, 1807–15).
New markets were opened to us in South
America; and the pent-up commercial enterprise of
our countrymen vented itself in that direction, with
wild disregard of the needs of consumers in that
quarter.<a id='r640'></a><a href='#f640' class='c016'><sup>[640]</sup></a> The same happened, with more reason, in
1814 and 1815. When peace was restored, it was
thought that the whole Continent must be eager to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>have our goods, after being so long without them;
and we sent them lavishly everywhere without waiting
for orders. Unhappily the rest of Europe was
exhausted by the war, which had lessened their
production; and such products as they could offer
us in exchange for our manufactures we seldom took
without taxing. The very food that we most wanted
from them we were careful to keep out till the last
moment.<a id='r641'></a><a href='#f641' class='c016'><sup>[641]</sup></a> Anything more unlike the “simple system
of natural liberty” could not be conceived; and the
result certainly seemed to be an over-production on
our part;—it was at any rate a reign of low prices
and deep commercial depression. This was not all.
Since 1797 we had had a paper currency of uncertain
value. In that year the Bank of England, whose
department of issue was not then separated from its
department of banking, gave advances to Government,
in return for which it was relieved of immediate
obligation to pay gold to the holders of its notes.
As long as the issues were moderate, the notes kept
their value; but this was a time when economical
substitutes for the currency, cheques and bills and
County notes, were lessening the proportion of the
Bank’s notes to the total transactions of trade; and
the Bank’s power of calculating the public need without
the natural safety-valve of convertibility became
more and more fallible; the circulation soon contained
superfluous paper, which dragged down the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>whole currency. In these circumstances, discussions on
currency gained an interest they could never have
had in the abstract; and they led to measures of the
most practical and permanent usefulness. Ricardo’s
tract <cite>The High Price of Gold Bullion a Proof of
the Depreciation of Bank-Notes</cite> (1809) prepared the
way for the Bullion Committee of the House of
Commons (1810), and through them for our own
Bank Charter Act (1844). Malthus played a more
quiet part. His chief writings on the subject of the
currency were two magazine articles, one in the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> of February 1811,<a id='r642'></a><a href='#f642' class='c016'><sup>[642]</sup></a> and another
in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> of April 1823.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first treats of <cite>The Depreciation of Paper Currency</cite>,
and is a review of pamphlets by the leading
advocates and assailants of the principles of the
Bullion Committee’s Report. The Committee had
inquired into three subjects: the high price of gold
bullion, the state of the currency, and the state
of the foreign Exchanges. As to the first, they
found that, while an ounce of standard gold was
converted at the Mint into £3 17<em>s.</em> 10½<em>d.</em> (which
sum was therefore the Mint price of gold bullion),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>the said ounce could not in the years 1806–8 be
bought by the Mint for less than £4 in bank-notes,
or in 1809 for less than £4 10<em>s</em>. The market price
had risen to that extent above the Mint price, of
gold bullion. As to the second, they found that
guineas had gone out of circulation, and were practically
replaced by small notes between £1 and £5.
Finally, as to the third, they found that from the end
of 1808 the Exchanges had become more and more
unfavourable to England, till in 1809–10 they were
with Hamburg nine, with Amsterdam seven, with
Paris more than fourteen per cent. below par. After
examination of witnesses and consideration of their
evidence, the Committee resolved “that there is at
present an excess in the paper circulation of this
country, of which the most unequivocal symptom is
the very high price of bullion, and next to that the
low state of the Continental Exchanges; that this
excess is to be ascribed to the want of a sufficient
check and control in the issues of paper from the
Bank of England, and originally to the suspension of
cash payments, which removed the natural and true
control.” The effects had been very serious, especially
on the wages of common country labour (<cite>Report</cite>,
p. 73); and the Committee recommend a speedy
return to the principle of cash payments, whether
the nation be at peace or war, though caution
demands that this take place gradually, in the space
of two years. It took place, not in two years, but in
more than ten, namely on 1st May 1821,<a id='r643'></a><a href='#f643' class='c016'><sup>[643]</sup></a> Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>not agreeing to the change till 1819.<a id='r644'></a><a href='#f644' class='c016'><sup>[644]</sup></a> Cobbett’s
venture (to be broiled on a gridiron when the Bank
paid in gold) seemed a perfectly safe one.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both Malthus and Ricardo agreed with the Report
of the Bullion Committee. Ricardo indeed is in a
sense the father of it. Malthus (in the <cite>Edin. Review</cite>)
speaks strongly of the bad policy and injustice of
continuing the suspension, and he does not spare the
Bank of England and its mischievous monopoly,<a id='r645'></a><a href='#f645' class='c016'><sup>[645]</sup></a> or
the “practical men” and their narrow views.<a id='r646'></a><a href='#f646' class='c016'><sup>[646]</sup></a> Yet
he finds fault with Ricardo here as elsewhere for
making his statements too absolute. Malthus’ fault
is in the contrary direction; he qualifies too much.<a id='r647'></a><a href='#f647' class='c016'><sup>[647]</sup></a>
He thinks that Ricardo has gone too far in attributing
all the movements of the Exchanges to excessive or
defective currency; a purely commercial excess of
imports over exports might, he thinks, cause the
same effects, and even in the high price of bullion it
was the commercial difficulty that began what the
depreciation of currency continued. Ricardo, who
replies in a long appendix,<a id='r648'></a><a href='#f648' class='c016'><sup>[648]</sup></a> answers, in substance,
that in any and every case money goes from where
it is cheaper to where it is dearer, and therefore from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>where the currency has lost value to where it has
gained it. But this hardly meets the contention of
Malthus, that the efficient cause, though it affects the
currency, is not in all cases the currency itself, and
in the case of an unequal balance of trade, however
temporary, the cause of the exportation of the money
is rather the superfluity of the goods in the foreign
country than the deficiency of the money there;—it
would be otherwise when the first cause was in the
currency itself. The rest of the article contains little
that is new to readers of the <cite>Political Economy</cite>, and
the reference to a possible over-production is chiefly
valuable as a sign of the authorship, and as showing
that the views of the author were becoming fixed.
The personal acquaintance of Malthus with Ricardo
dates probably from the appearance of this article;<a id='r649'></a><a href='#f649' class='c016'><sup>[649]</sup></a> and
they continued to discuss and correspond, in perfect
friendship, till the death of Ricardo in Sept. 1823.<a id='r650'></a><a href='#f650' class='c016'><sup>[650]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>His friendship with the Edinburgh Reviewers
remained unbroken; and, when he wrote in the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, it was the <cite>Review</cite> not the writer
that had changed. On finance, indeed, the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> had been saved from unsoundness by Canning’s
influence,<a id='r651'></a><a href='#f651' class='c016'><sup>[651]</sup></a> and an article on Tooke’s <cite>Prices</cite> need have
no politics.</p>

<p class='c007'>There can be little doubt that Thomas Tooke<a id='r652'></a><a href='#f652' class='c016'><sup>[652]</sup></a> was
right in holding the difference between the Mint
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>price and the market price of gold bullion to be the
full measure of the effect of this depreciation upon
prices, the rest of the increase being due to great
demand with small supply, being as a rule much
exaggerated and in its worst forms purely local. He
pointed out that there was, as a matter of fact, no
coincidence between the Bank’s contraction or extension
of its issues and the fall or rise of prices in the
market outside. Prices rose, for example, in 1795
and 1796, when the Bank’s circulation had been not
extended but contracted to meet the commercial
crisis; and in 1798, when the Bank’s issues were
larger, prices actually fell to what they had been in
1793. Moreover, when some prices went up, others
went down. When the prices of provisions went
up in 1799 and 1800, the prices of colonial wares
went down. The ruling cause (Tooke argues) was not
the issue of many or few bank-notes, but scarcity
and plenty, especially the plenty of a good harvest
and the scarcity of a bad one. Wages in the same
way fluctuated rather by the harvests than by the
currency, but not by either so much as by the
changes in general trade; it would not be true to
say that the high or low prices produced high or
low wages, but what produced the one produced the
other. The recoil of the speculation that followed
the Peace brought down both together; there was
a glut not only of goods but of hands; and there
were the discarded men of the army to swell the
numbers of the unemployed. The Luddite outbreaks
against machines, as taking work away from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>hands, had made a notable beginning in 1812 during
the war; in 1816, the year after the Peace, they began
again with greater violence. The discussions of Say
and Malthus on Over-production, and the reasonings
in Ricardo (1817) and James Mill (1821) on Wages
and the Wages Fund, are as truly commentaries on
these events as the Letter of Cobbett to the Luddites<a id='r653'></a><a href='#f653' class='c016'><sup>[653]</sup></a>
or the volumes of Tooke on Prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus has adroitly used the work of Tooke to
support his own economical positions. In a review in
the <cite>Quarterly</cite> for April 1823<a id='r654'></a><a href='#f654' class='c016'><sup>[654]</sup></a> (pages 214 <em>seq.</em>) he
tries to show that Mr. Tooke’s conclusions as to the
high and low prices of the past thirty years prove the
following general statements:—First, that values and
therefore prices depend on the supply compared with
the demand, and are only affected by the labour required
to produce goods (<em>i. e.</em> by what Ricardo counts
the main cause of value) so far as this labour is the
main condition of their supply; second, that the
supply and demand are chiefly affected by the seasons,
and, of the other causes, war may limit the supply but
can hardly cause a demand; third, that when demand
outruns supply trade is brisk, when supply outruns
demand trade is dull; and that, finally, a long-continued
deficiency or a long-continued excess of this
kind brings with it a fall or a rise in the value of the
precious metals.<a id='r655'></a><a href='#f655' class='c016'><sup>[655]</sup></a> Malthus, however, goes further than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>Tooke with the Bullion Committee. Though on the
bullion question the opposing parties, Bosanquet and
Ricardo, seemed to him to be devoted to a preconceived
theory,<a id='r656'></a><a href='#f656' class='c016'><sup>[656]</sup></a> the Report itself was “more free from
this error of preconception than any work that had
appeared on the subject;”<a id='r657'></a><a href='#f657' class='c016'><sup>[657]</sup></a> and he agreed with it that
there had been a greater rise of prices and of wages
at the end of the period of restriction, than could be
explained by the bad seasons, and demand for men,
and the difference between paper and gold. He is
old-fashioned enough to think that even with convertibility
there might be over-issue and depreciation,
and speculation on a basis of paper. His reasoning
on this point is hardly sound. It depends on a
misapplication of the axiom that, in the case of
necessaries, a very small deficiency in the supply will
cause a very great increase in the price,—<em>e. g.</em> that
wheat may rise from 100 to 200 per cent. when the
deficiency of the crops is not more than 15 or 30.<a id='r658'></a><a href='#f658' class='c016'><sup>[658]</sup></a>
The profits of English farmers between 1793 and
1815 must therefore have been enormous; and
Malthus, though he loves agriculture above manufacture,
has taken account of these high gains of
individuals in judging the cause of the Agricultural
Interest against the public.<a id='r659'></a><a href='#f659' class='c016'><sup>[659]</sup></a> But in connection with
currency he actually speaks as if those gains were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>a public advantage; be does not see they were a
mere transference of public wealth, not an addition
to it. The farmer, he says, is obviously “able to set
in motion a much greater quantity of industry than
before,” at least till wages have risen. “The specific
funds destined for the maintenance of labour, though
diminished in quantity, are by this happy provision of
nature increased in their efficiency;” labourers get
more employment, and there is “a burst of prosperity
to the producing classes.”<a id='r660'></a><a href='#f660' class='c016'><sup>[660]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This is a near approach to a worse fallacy than the
Wages Fund. The archaic reasoning is the more
unhappy, because the reasoner proceeds to use it
in a good cause. Jean Baptiste Say<a id='r661'></a><a href='#f661' class='c016'><sup>[661]</sup></a> had taught
that all increased or diminished demand depended on
increased or diminished supply, and argued thence,
with James Mill and Ricardo, the impossibility of
general or rather universal gluts. Goods<a id='r662'></a><a href='#f662' class='c016'><sup>[662]</sup></a> being
always meant to be exchanged with goods, one-half
will furnish a market for the other half; and thus, as
production (which gives the means of buying) is the
sole source of demand (so far as demand is effective),
an excess in the supply of one article merely proves a
deficiency in the supply of another, and is improperly
called over-production. Indeed, whereas consumption
takes an article away from the market, production
brings one into it, and thereby increases, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tanto</span></i>, the
demand by increasing the means of buying. James
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Mill’s neat demonstration of this doctrine<a id='r663'></a><a href='#f663' class='c016'><sup>[663]</sup></a> would be
quite conclusive if we, first of all, defined demand
and supply so as to include each other, and, second,
supposed general to mean universal. The reply of
Malthus himself is that goods are not always
exchanged for goods, but frequently, perhaps most
frequently, for labour. Say rejoins that he for his
part used a term (“products”) which includes both
goods and services, and that the latter are always
the real object of an exchange.<a id='r664'></a><a href='#f664' class='c016'><sup>[664]</sup></a> Malthus makes a
better point when he accuses his opponents of treating
goods as if they were mathematical symbols, instead
of objects of human consumption owing their whole
character to human wants.<a id='r665'></a><a href='#f665' class='c016'><sup>[665]</sup></a> But his case could be
made convincing even on his opponents’ premises.
Division of labour, all admitted, is limited by the
extent of the market;<a id='r666'></a><a href='#f666' class='c016'><sup>[666]</sup></a> allow that the most satisfactory
cure for the limitation is to widen the market,
not to lessen the division of the labour—still, <em>given</em>
the limitation of the market, the extension of the
division of the labour will cause an over-production.
All that Malthus maintained was that this might
happen in a great many cases as well as in a few;
Say went as near as he dared to the assertion that it
could not happen at all.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>The question of a market, again, is not a mere
question of numbers but of wants. A carpet factory,
for example, among a people who preferred bare floors
would have no market, whatever the numbers and
even the wealth of the people. Say does not do full
justice to Malthus in this connection. He thinks
that the author of the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> cannot
consistently believe in the possibility of a great
abundance of products together with a stationary
number of parsimonious consumers. But Malthus
had allowed that in one case, the case of food, there
could be no over-production,<a id='r667'></a><a href='#f667' class='c016'><sup>[667]</sup></a> the want in that case
being constant, whereas, curiously enough, Ricardo
thinks that food is the one object of which there
might be a glut. “If every man were to forego the
use of luxuries and be intent only on accumulation, a
quantity of necessaries might be produced for which
there could not be any immediate consumption. Of
commodities so limited in number there might
undoubtedly be a universal glut, and consequently
there might neither be demand for an additional
quantity of such commodities nor profits on the
employment of more capital. If men ceased to
consume they would cease to produce. This admission
does not impugn the general principle,” for
there is no likelihood of such a contingency as it
supposes;—there is a limit to the desire of food,
but there is no limit to the desire of other good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>things.<a id='r668'></a><a href='#f668' class='c016'><sup>[668]</sup></a> The insatiableness of human desires is here
assumed by Ricardo to be always full-grown, instead
of what it is, in perhaps three-fourths of the world,
an undeveloped possibility. Till we know that the
possibility has become actual, we cannot take for
granted that all we produce will be wanted.
Malthus did not enter with sympathy or even with
full intelligence into the spirit of modern trade. But
he sees that large manufacture, with its complement
of speculative trading, must succeed or fail precisely
as it has judged rightly or judged wrongly of its
markets, for it no longer, like the old English small
production, waits for orders—it anticipates, woos, and
coaxes them. He believes that the awakening of
man’s insatiable wants will tend to secure us against
both over-population and over-production, by creating
a high standard of living. The taste for luxuries,
whatever its positive advantages, from the educational
or artistic point of view, confers at least this
economical benefit.<a id='r669'></a><a href='#f669' class='c016'><sup>[669]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus gets a similar result by applying to wages
his favourite idea of the golden mean. The “funds
destined to pay wages” may, he says, be increased
either by high prices or by great production at low
prices,—increased value without increased quantity,
or increased quantity without increased value. The
latter is the more secure way, but it lies on the
road to “glut.” The most desirable plan is the union
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>of the two. “There is somewhere a happy mean,
where, under the actual resources of a country, both
the increase of wealth and the demand for labour
may be a maximum. A taste for conveniences and
comforts not only tends to create a more steady
demand for labour than a taste for personal services,
but by cheapening manufactures and the products of
foreign commerce, including many of the necessaries
of the labouring classes, it actually enlarges the limits
of the effectual demand for labour, and renders it
for a longer time effective.”<a id='r670'></a><a href='#f670' class='c016'><sup>[670]</sup></a> If any one had urged
against this, in the words of Mill, that a demand
for goods is not a demand for labour, but simply
gives labour a new direction, Malthus would probably
have answered that the new direction was all
important, because the trade begun in it might be a
trade in goods more widely used, and might therefore
last longer and more steadily than the old trade.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see that in his views of this subject, expounded
tediously enough, and at unnecessary length, Malthus
had constant thought of the relations of production
and distribution to consumption as well as to each
other, for the condition of the people was always
more important to him than the state of the articles
concerned. But he never yielded to his feelings so far
as to adopt Sismondi’s reactionary ideas on the effects
of machinery on the workmen.<a id='r671'></a><a href='#f671' class='c016'><sup>[671]</sup></a> He never wrote any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>description of the evils of division of labour at all so
strong as Adam Smith’s.<a id='r672'></a><a href='#f672' class='c016'><sup>[672]</sup></a> He goes little farther than
Ricardo, who says in a well-known passage:—“The
same cause which may increase the nett revenue of
the country may at the same time render the population
redundant and deteriorate the condition of the
labourer,” for all the increase may possibly be devoted
to fixed and not circulating capital, to machinery and
buildings instead of wages.<a id='r673'></a><a href='#f673' class='c016'><sup>[673]</sup></a> Ricardo’s admission, that
he was wrong in not recognizing this sooner, makes
us wonder (as men were even then doing in Germany
over similar confessions of their philosophers) whether
his demonstrations are more accurate than ordinary
reasonings. His brother economists never claimed
infallibility. Adam Smith gave up his defence of
Usury Laws.<a id='r674'></a><a href='#f674' class='c016'><sup>[674]</sup></a> Malthus amended his first views on
population, to say nothing of the measure of value.<a id='r675'></a><a href='#f675' class='c016'><sup>[675]</sup></a>
Mill gave up the Wages Fund. It was only the
minor economists who proudly remained at the end
where they were at the beginning. James Mill refused
to follow Ricardo in allowing that food could
be over-produced, and MacCulloch refused to go with
him in the admission above quoted, that increase of
wealth might go to fixed capital instead of wages.<a id='r676'></a><a href='#f676' class='c016'><sup>[676]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Orthodox economy became most abstract when on the
death of Ricardo in 1823 its doctrines passed into the
hands of the Minor Prophets.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the last ten years of his life Malthus made
no serious change in his economical views, and
approached no nearer to the Ricardians. They were
years when economists and political reformers had
not learned to work together so harmoniously as they
were to do after his death. Huskisson’s changes in
commercial policy were preparing the way in high
quarters for free trade. The sliding scale of corn
duties introduced in 1826 pointed on the whole in
the same direction. But the agitation of the humbler
classes for political freedom, made solid as it was
by an appreciable progress in popular education,<a id='r677'></a><a href='#f677' class='c016'><sup>[677]</sup></a>
and kept within bounds of law by the influence of
Cobbett,<a id='r678'></a><a href='#f678' class='c016'><sup>[678]</sup></a> went on in a way apart; and it will be
remembered how Chartism stood aloof from the Anti-Corn-Law
League. A man might be an advanced
economist and social reformer and a reactionary in
politics. In 1824, when trades unions were for the
first time allowed by law and the Factory Acts were
still too imperfect to give the weak a fair chance
against the strong, the “natural state of things,” free
development of individual and national faculties, did
not exist; and Malthus, who missed them keenly,
would have been much amazed to hear that his
doctrines were, like Ricardo’s, a vindication of things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>as they are. Not only the notorious fact of his opposition
to Ricardo, but his views on commercial policy
are against the notion.<a id='r679'></a><a href='#f679' class='c016'><sup>[679]</sup></a> At the Peace there were
many fallacies current about wages. The new Corn
Law of 1815 had inaugurated the aggressive policy of
the agricultural interest, who frankly endeavoured, by
forms of law, to convert an occasional scarcity into a
permanent one, and keep prices at 80<em>s.</em> a quarter. Not
a few false friends of the working man recommended
him to countenance the law and let his bread be made
dear, for then, said they, his wages would be made
high. Many manufacturers, on the other hand, were
declaring the interest of the country to be low wages,
and, unto that end, cheap food and a great population.
Malthus was with neither. His partial approval of
the new Corn Law was no doubt based on erroneous
grounds; but he held no such mistaken views of
wages. His opinion, if not sufficiently obvious from
his general views of population, was laid down explicitly
in all his writings. He says, for example:
“If a country can only be rich, by running a successful
race for low wages, I should be disposed to say at
once ‘Perish such riches!’”<a id='r680'></a><a href='#f680' class='c016'><sup>[680]</sup></a> “It is most desirable
that the labouring classes should be well paid, for a
much more important reason than any that can relate
to wealth, namely, the happiness of the great mass of
society.”<a id='r681'></a><a href='#f681' class='c016'><sup>[681]</sup></a> Being asked, “In a national point of view,
even if it were admitted that the low rate of wages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>was an advantage to the capitalist, do you think it
fitting that labour should be kept permanently in a
state bordering on distress, to avoid the injury that
might accrue to the national wealth from diminishing
the rate of profit?” he answered, “I should say, by
no means fitting; I consider the labouring classes as
forming the largest part of the nation, and therefore
that their general condition is the most important
of all.”<a id='r682'></a><a href='#f682' class='c016'><sup>[682]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>He thinks, however, that the change from low
to high wages might quite possibly so reduce profits
as to make trade unprofitable. We might need to
sacrifice something of our commercial prosperity. He
cannot rise to the conception of a society in which
the entire body of workmen as consumers would be
a sufficient market for the same body as producers.
He cannot rid himself of the idea that a body of
unproductive consumers is a social necessity, to give
a stimulus to production by developing the wants
which the manufactures are to satisfy. It seems
easy to answer that those unproductive consumers
can only pay for the manufactures by means of other
products, whencesoever obtained, and there seems no
reason why their producers should not obtain them.<a id='r683'></a><a href='#f683' class='c016'><sup>[683]</sup></a>
If the workmen themselves had the wants and supplied
them by their own labour, all the results that
Malthus desires would be obtained without invidious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>distinctions of classes, and with distinct improvement
in the condition of the workmen. His aims, at
least, were good. The indispensable leisure would
be secured if the hours of labour were shortened,
as he desired them to be. “I have always thought
and felt that many among the labouring classes in
this country work too hard for their health, happiness,
and intellectual improvement.”<a id='r684'></a><a href='#f684' class='c016'><sup>[684]</sup></a> The general
wealth therefore, if need be, must be sacrificed to
the general happiness. Factory Acts that would prevent
children from labouring too young or too long<a id='r685'></a><a href='#f685' class='c016'><sup>[685]</sup></a>
he thoroughly approves; though such Factory Acts
as would interfere with adult labour he considers
an injustice to the work-people themselves, and a
hopeless interference with “the principles of competition,
one of the most general principles by which
the business of society is carried on.”<a id='r686'></a><a href='#f686' class='c016'><sup>[686]</sup></a> The salvation
of the labouring classes must come from themselves,
from their own “simultaneous resolution to work
fewer hours in the day.” But trades unions, as we
now know them, had not then come into being; and
he talks of a future improvement of the working
classes in knowledge, comfort, and self-restraint,<a id='r687'></a><a href='#f687' class='c016'><sup>[687]</sup></a> with
much hesitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen that the economics of Malthus,
whether in relation to the landlords, the employers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>or the workmen, are by no means identical with the
economics of Ricardo and his school, which have been
the ruling and orthodox doctrine for the first half of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would be neither complimentary nor true to
ascribe the difference to the logic of sentiment; but
it is true that the acute sensitiveness of Malthus to
the evils of poverty kept constantly before him large
classes of facts which Ricardo seemed willing to
forget, and the path that he took, though long ago
obscured and forgotten, led him in some important
points away from <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</span></i> to doctrines of our
own day, in which society acting through its Government
is allowed an originative and not merely a
regulative action in the matter of industry and
wealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Resuming the thread of the essay, we shall find
that the relation of society to its destitute poor is
not to Malthus, as to Ricardo, a question of taxation
and finance, but a problem of morals and politics,
which could only be solved by a clear view of the
relation of the citizen to the commonwealth.</p>

times, the Third is supposed to deal with the “different
systems of expedients which have been proposed
or have prevailed in society” for curing the evils
arising from the principle of population, while the
Fourth relates to the future prospects of society, and
the possibility of removing the evils in question. This
division of the subject could not be maintained very
strictly. The “systems proposed” no doubt were
in most cases mere theories and could be considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>by themselves; but the “systems that prevailed”
included such laws as the Corn Laws and Poor Laws,
which directly affected the present habits and wealth
of the people, and might fairly have been considered
in the second book. The fourth book might quite
logically have been part of the third, for it simply
adds to the “systems proposed” the proposal of
Malthus himself. The arrangement is not in itself
so perfect or so closely respected by its author that
we need have any remorse for disregarding it. The
earliest chapters of the third book (i. and ii.) are
substantially the refutation of Godwin, Wallace,
Condorcet, as it appeared in 1798, with a postscript
(ch. iii.) on Owen and Spence, which will be best
considered in another place.<a id='r689'></a><a href='#f689' class='c016'><sup>[689]</sup></a> In point of style they
are probably the best in the book.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a chapter (iv.) on Emigration<a id='r690'></a><a href='#f690' class='c016'><sup>[690]</sup></a> come three
chapters on the Poor Laws, to be viewed with ch.
viii. of the fourth book, which deals with Plans for
their Abolition. Of all the applications of the doctrines
of Malthus, their application to pauperism was
probably, at the time, of the greatest public interest.
Even the first essay had distinct bearing on Pitt’s
Poor Bill; the next writing of the author was on a
question of parish relief; and these three chapters
in the later <cite>Essay on Population</cite> have influenced
public opinion and legislation about the destitute
poor almost as powerfully as the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> has
influenced commercial policy. Malthus is the father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>not only of the new Poor Law, but of all our latter-day
societies for the organization of charity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject is best introduced in the words of a
celebrated parable, which Malthus having used once
was never afterwards allowed to forget:<a id='r691'></a><a href='#f691' class='c016'><sup>[691]</sup></a>—“A man
who is born into a world already possessed, if he
cannot get subsistence from his parents, on whom he
has a just demand, and if the society do not want
his labour, has no claim of <em>right</em> to the smallest portion
of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he
is. At nature’s mighty feast there is no vacant cover
for him. She tells him to be gone, and will quickly
execute her own orders, if he do not work upon the
compassion of some of her guests. If these guests
get up and make room for him, other intruders
immediately appear demanding the same favour.
The report of a provision for all that come, fills the
hall with numerous claimants. The order and harmony
of the feast is disturbed, the plenty that before
reigned is changed into scarcity; and the happiness
of the guests is destroyed by the spectacle of misery
and dependence in every part of the hall, and by
the clamorous importunity of those, who are justly
enraged at not finding the provision which they had
been taught to expect. The guests learn too late
their error, in counteracting those strict orders to all
intruders, issued by the great mistress of the feast,
who, wishing that all her guests should have plenty,
and knowing that she could not provide for unlimited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>numbers, humanely refused to admit fresh comers
when her table was already full.”<a id='r692'></a><a href='#f692' class='c016'><sup>[692]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Our neighbours’ misfortunes have seldom been
made so picturesque. The figure itself was no new
one. Lucretius had written:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cur non, ut plenus vitæ conviva, recedis?</span>”<a id='r693'></a><a href='#f693' class='c016'><sup>[693]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>and Fenton, in Pope’s<a id='r694'></a><a href='#f694' class='c016'><sup>[694]</sup></a> familiar lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From Nature’s temperate feast rose satisfied,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thanked heaven that he had lived and that he died.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>But the new application took hold on the public
fancy. Sir William Pulteney and Windham are
said to have been, beyond others, delighted with
its conservative moral.<a id='r695'></a><a href='#f695' class='c016'><sup>[695]</sup></a> Malthus may have got
the hint of it from a passage in Paley’s <cite>Moral
and Political Philosophy</cite>. Paley was criticizing a
justification of private property, which founded it
on every man’s right to take what he wants of the
things God made for the use of all, just as, when
an entertainment is given to the freeholders (as the
free and independent electors?) of a county, we see
them coming in and eating and drinking each what
he chooses, without asking the consent of the other
guests. The simile, says Paley, is not perfect, for
in a freeholder’s feast nobody is allowed to fill his
pockets or to throw anything away, “especially if by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>so doing he pinched the guests at the lower end of
the table.”<a id='r696'></a><a href='#f696' class='c016'><sup>[696]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Even the friends of Malthus thought the passage
too gloomy; and, as every one noticed,<a id='r697'></a><a href='#f697' class='c016'><sup>[697]</sup></a> it was not
retained after 1803. It contains, however, at least
two positions that were never retracted:—that the
poor cannot claim relief as a right, but only as a
favour, and that poor relief can only raise one man
by depressing another. The latter position may be
illustrated from the tract written in 1800 on the
<cite>High Price of Provisions</cite>. The main aim of the tract
was to show that the price was too extravagantly high
to be due to the deficiency, which was admittedly
only one-fourth. But the author throws light on his
own general doctrines.<a id='r698'></a><a href='#f698' class='c016'><sup>[698]</sup></a> He argues, in substance,
that to give relief in money is to enable the relieved
persons to retain their ordinary rate of consumption
at the expense of the rest. To this the reply is
obvious:—the sufficiency of the stock is not so
finely calculated, neither is the amount of it so fixed
that it cannot be increased from home or foreign
stores,—and to withdraw money from the rich for the
poor, and increase the country’s total expenditure on
necessaries, might be simply to divert the stream of
importation into the channel of necessaries, and lead
to a larger use of food other than bread. Under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>conditions of the time, however, the author’s views
were not unnatural. On his return from Sweden in 1800
he found scarcity prevailing in England as elsewhere,
but with prices much higher than in other countries.
These were the days when Chief Justice Kenyon and
a jury enforced the antiquated laws against forestalling
and regrating.<a id='r699'></a><a href='#f699' class='c016'><sup>[699]</sup></a> Malthus had not read his Adam
Smith to so little purpose that he could approve such
proceedings; much of his pamphlet was simply an
application, to one particular case, of the principles
of the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> (Book IV. chap. v.).<a id='r700'></a><a href='#f700' class='c016'><sup>[700]</sup></a> Neither
could he agree with the notion that the paper currency
had done it all.<a id='r701'></a><a href='#f701' class='c016'><sup>[701]</sup></a> Settling down to his parish
work in Surrey, he watched the course of events.
What happened, he said, there and presumably elsewhere
was as follows:—In progress of the scarcity the
poor complained to the justices that their wages were
too low to buy bread at present prices; the justices
thereupon inquired at what, as the lowest wages, they
would have been able to buy it, and then “very
humanely, and I am far from saying improperly,”
gave parish relief accordingly.<a id='r702'></a><a href='#f702' class='c016'><sup>[702]</sup></a> But, like the water
from the mouth of Tantalus, the corn slipped from
the grasp of the poor; prices rose a step further, and
the relief had to follow the prices.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rates accordingly rose in many places from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>four to fourteen shillings in the pound. By the
double burden of dear food and high rates, perhaps
five or six millions of the richer classes were certainly
made to feel the pinch of the scarcity, which would
otherwise have been borne, say by two millions of
the poorest, who would have died under it.<a id='r703'></a><a href='#f703' class='c016'><sup>[703]</sup></a> In this
instance the Poor Laws did the country a distinct
service. But it was done by taking from the first
guests to give to the importunate intruders, and
could not justify a general eulogy of the Poor Laws.
The whole drift of the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> had gone
against such institutions; and “two years’ reflection,”
says the writer of the <cite>Essay</cite>, “have served strongly
to convince me of the truth of the principle there
advanced, and of its being the real cause of the continued
depression and poverty of the lower classes
of society, of the total inadequacy of all the present
establishments in their favour to relieve them, and
of the [certainty of] periodical returns of such seasons
of distress as we have of late experienced.”<a id='r704'></a><a href='#f704' class='c016'><sup>[704]</sup></a> In the
first essay he had spoken strongly not only against
Pitt’s new Poor Bill, but against all legal relief, and
amongst other reasons precisely on the ground that it
caused food to rise in price beyond the point to which
scarcity would have raised it apart from interference.<a id='r705'></a><a href='#f705' class='c016'><sup>[705]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The second was a stronger reason;—in the language
of Kant, the claim allowed (with little qualification<a id='r706'></a><a href='#f706' class='c016'><sup>[706]</sup></a>)
by the English Poor Laws was a claim that could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>be made universal without contradiction. If every one
exercised the supposed right of demanding relief, no
community could fulfil the supposed duty of granting
it.<a id='r707'></a><a href='#f707' class='c016'><sup>[707]</sup></a> If it could have been fulfilled, Malthus thinks,
the obligation would have held; and, instead of declaring
“I cannot, therefore I ought not,” he would
have confessed, “I can, therefore I ought.”<a id='r708'></a><a href='#f708' class='c016'><sup>[708]</sup></a> As the
case stands, he agrees with Sir Frederick Eden in
thinking the giving of legal relief impracticable, and
therefore no duty, and also that, “upon the whole,
the sum of good to be expected from a compulsory
maintenance of the poor will be far outbalanced by
the sum of evil which it will inevitably create.”<a id='r709'></a><a href='#f709' class='c016'><sup>[709]</sup></a> It
relieved individual suffering at the cost of making
the suffering general. It created the poor which
it maintained, for it led men to marry with the
certainty of parish assistance. It thereby increased
the population without increasing the food of the
country, and it has to a large extent broken down
the ancient spirit of independence. “Hard as it
may appear in individual instances, dependent poverty
ought to be held disgraceful.”<a id='r710'></a><a href='#f710' class='c016'><sup>[710]</sup></a> High wages and
independence and moral restraint are better than low
wages with a parish supplement and a pauper family.
“I feel persuaded that if the Poor Laws had never
existed in this country, though there might have
been a few more instances of very severe distress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>the aggregate mass of happiness among the common
people would have been much greater than it is at
present.”<a id='r711'></a><a href='#f711' class='c016'><sup>[711]</sup></a> This was his belief to the end.<a id='r712'></a><a href='#f712' class='c016'><sup>[712]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>An allegory of these things may be found in Dr.
John Moore’s description of the army of Frederick
the Great. Dr. Moore saw a man caned for being
a few seconds late in replacing his ramrod; and the
officers told him that, since they could not distinguish
wilful blunders from accidental, they punished all
alike, and the result, they said, was excellent; all the
men were on the alert, and fewer blunders were committed
on the whole. It used to be common on
field-days for dragoons to have their hats blown off
and to be thrown from their horses. At last a general
gave orders to punish every man to whom either of
these accidents happened; since then hardly anybody
lost his hat or fell from his horse. Dr. Moore
heard of a poor hussar who had fallen from his horse
at last review, and was to be punished for it as soon
as he could leave the hospital. This seemed hard,
but the King of Prussia thought he could only hope
to make his army superior to others by improving
its discipline, training its officers by honour and
disgrace, and its privates by physical punishment; he
considered that the occasional suffering of an innocent
individual does less harm to an army than the toleration
of negligence, which makes the negligence
greater.<a id='r713'></a><a href='#f713' class='c016'><sup>[713]</sup></a> So far as legal relief goes, Malthus would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>recommend the same martial severity, and try to put
men on their guard against poverty by making them
bear the discipline of its consequences. There are
other points in which the allegory applies to the
“simple system of natural liberty;” the discipline of
industrial competition is certainly in some respects as
severe as the discipline of an army. On the other
hand, society does not consist of picked strong men,
but includes the weak also, and its privates are supposed
not to take their orders from a commander, but
to “fend for themselves.” Society under socialism
may resemble an army, but not society under individualism.
Malthus, therefore, would have repudiated
the analogy. He does not reach his conclusions by
a preconceived theory of the state, but by observing
the ill results of the common preconceived theory that
every citizen when destitute has a right to be supported
by the state. He finds that, as a matter of
fact, where material relief has been given as a duty,
and claimed as a right, the effect on the recipient has
been clearly bad; the Poor Law stands condemned
by experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet he admits that the badness of the law has
been largely counteracted by the remissness of its
execution. The attempt to secure a fixed rate of
wages to the labourer in all states of trade has not
really been made in England as the Elizabethan Poor
Law enjoined. The scantiness of the relief actually
given, together with the insolence of the officials
concerned in the giving of it, has disturbed the
sense of complete security, which in the view of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>Malthus would in such a case have been fatal. “The
desire of bettering our condition and the fear of
making it worse, like the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis mediatrix naturæ</span></i> in
physics, is the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis mediatrix reipublicæ</span></i> in politics, and
is continually counteracting the disorders arising from
narrow human institutions.” The Poor Law has been
so imperfectly carried out that it has left some room
still for prudential motives among the labourers;
they cannot count on complete provision for their
families if they marry recklessly, and some few of
them still think caution needful. Moreover, from
fear of the Poor Law the rich will often refuse to
build cottages, lest their occupants become paupers.<a id='r714'></a><a href='#f714' class='c016'><sup>[714]</sup></a>
In the third place, pauper children, like foundlings,
do not live long.<a id='r715'></a><a href='#f715' class='c016'><sup>[715]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In his <cite>Letter to Samuel Whitbread, M.P., on his
proposed Bill for the amendment of the Poor Laws</cite>
(1807), Malthus allows that abolition must not come
till public opinion is ripe for it; but he recommends
legislation in the direction of abolition, to prepare the
minds of all classes for the final steps, and to expose
to the working classes the delusiveness of the present
boon. Poor Laws, he says, are peculiar to England,
and their absence in other countries does not seem
to have the effects expected from their abolition here.
In reply to Malthus, it might be urged that the
Poor Laws are not entirely peculiar to England, but
occur in Denmark and elsewhere.<a id='r716'></a><a href='#f716' class='c016'><sup>[716]</sup></a> In the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>place, as MacCulloch argues in a letter, aimed at
Malthus, to Macvey Napier,<a id='r717'></a><a href='#f717' class='c016'><sup>[717]</sup></a> Britain is peculiarly
subject to fluctuations in trade, due, for example, to
the changes in foreign tariffs, and therefore there are
more cases of sudden and unavoidable distress, that
need such a provision as the Poor Law’s. In the third
place, too, it is difficult to see how we can make
begging unlawful if we make legal relief inaccessible,<a id='r718'></a><a href='#f718' class='c016'><sup>[718]</sup></a>
any more than we can logically make education
compulsory while we insist on the payment of
fees. In the fourth place, an indiscriminate private
charity is probably more mischievous than a discriminating
public relief. Malthus, however, was not
against all relief, but only against it when claimed
as a right; and he was fully aware that the risks of
the English working man were greater than those of
his Continental brethren. All he desired was to give
the workman scope for that sense of personal responsibility
out of which the Poor Law was beguiling
him. He knew quite well that no good end would
be served by the removal of the Poor Law, unless the
public had been educated out of the evil ways of it.
He proposed therefore to make a gradual change,
the essence of which was to be the disclaimer of any
right on the part of a poor man to be supported
at the public expense; children have a right to be
supported by their parents, but not by the public.<a id='r719'></a><a href='#f719' class='c016'><sup>[719]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>Let a law be passed, he said, declaring that no
legitimate child born from any marriage taking place
a year after the law’s enactment, and no illegitimate
born two years thereafter, shall ever be entitled to
parish relief. “And to give a more general knowledge
of this law, and to enforce it more strongly on
the minds of the lower classes of people, the clergyman
of each parish should, previously to the solemnization
of a marriage, read a short address to the
parties, stating the strong obligation on every man
to support his own children; the impropriety, and
even immorality, of marrying without a fair prospect
of being able to do this; the evils which had resulted
to the poor themselves, from the attempt which had
been made to assist, by public institutions, in a duty
which ought to be exclusively appropriated to parents,
and the absolute necessity which had at length
appeared, of abandoning all such institutions, on
account of their producing effects totally opposite to
those which were intended. This would operate as a
fair, distinct, and precise notice which no man could
well mistake, and without pressing hard upon any
particular individuals, would at once throw off the
rising generation from their miserable and helpless
dependence upon the Government and the rich.”<a id='r720'></a><a href='#f720' class='c016'><sup>[720]</sup></a>
Both their irritation against the upper classes and
their helplessness in devising expedients in time of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>want, arise from “the wretched system of governing
too much. When the poor were once taught, by the
abolition of the Poor Laws, and a proper knowledge of
their real situation, to depend more upon themselves,
we might rest secure that they would be fruitful
enough in resources, and that the evils which were
absolutely irremediable they would bear with the
fortitude of men and the resignation of Christians.”<a id='r721'></a><a href='#f721' class='c016'><sup>[721]</sup></a>
However comical may be the picture of a clergyman
following up the very un-Malthusian marriage service
by such a moral lecture as is here recommended, the
principle of the recommendation is sober sense, and
has largely influenced the benevolence of later philanthropists.
Dr. Chalmers applied it in his Parochial
System, which would have been an admirable substitute
for the Poor Law on the (unfortunately untrue)
hypothesis of an absence of sects. The Mendicity
Society (dating from 1815) and the Charity Organisation
(from 1869) build on the same foundation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new Poor Law of 1834 differed from Malthus in
that it did not deny the right to relieve, and still kept
up the fiction that the law of Elizabeth was good, and
we had degenerated from it.<a id='r722'></a><a href='#f722' class='c016'><sup>[722]</sup></a> But it allowed the
right only to the indigent,<a id='r723'></a><a href='#f723' class='c016'><sup>[723]</sup></a> refusing all relief in aid of
wages to the merely poor and the able-bodied; and
it carried out the principle that dependent poverty
(in the words of Malthus) should be held disgraceful
and made disagreeable. “Every penny bestowed that
tends to render the condition of a pauper more eligible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>than that of the independent labourer is a bounty on
indolence and vice.” “In proportion as the condition
of any pauper class is elevated above the condition
of independent labourers, the condition of the independent
class is depressed.”<a id='r724'></a><a href='#f724' class='c016'><sup>[724]</sup></a> If this meant that poor
relief should run a race with the average wages of
labour, keeping always one stage behind them, it
might be argued that in good times a pauper would
get too much comfort and in bad times too little food.
But the disgrace of dependence and the discomfort of
constraint are the deterrents which Malthus himself
has most in mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without the discussions raised by the <cite>Essay on
Population</cite> it is very doubtful if public opinion would
have been so far advanced in 1834 as to make a bill,
drawn on such lines, at all likely to pass into law.
The abolition of outdoor relief to the able-bodied was
nothing short of a revolution. It had needed a lifetime
of economical doctrine, reproof, and correction
to convince our public men, and to some extent
the nation, that the way of rigour was at once the
way of justice, of mercy, and of self-interest. The
history of the English Poor Law is ample proof that
men do not instinctively follow their own interest.
It was the ratepayer’s interest,<a id='r725'></a><a href='#f725' class='c016'><sup>[725]</sup></a> unless he was an
employer, that relief should be sparely given; and it
was given lavishly. It was the poor man’s interest
to be thrifty and sober; and as a rule he was neither.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>There was no hope of reform till both rich and poor
learned a deeper sense of their personal responsibility
for the remoter effects of their own acts, whether
unwisely benevolent or heedlessly selfish. The clear
consciousness of personal responsibility seems to
Malthus to be the soul and centre of every healthy
reform. In this sense, at least, he would say that
virtue is knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>His thoughts on society are connected at this point
with his thoughts on man’s place and duty in the
world. His psychology and ethics, slightly as they
are sketched, throw light on his sociology and
economics, and must be considered before we can
estimate his position in social philosophy. This will
lead us over the greater portion of the fourth book of
the essay, leaving the critical chapters till we come
to deal with the Critics as a body.</p>

<p class='c006'>The moral philosophy of Malthus, like that of Aristotle,
starts from a teleology.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nature makes nothing in vain. Every desire has
its proper place and proper gratification, if we can find
them. The passions are the materials out of which
happiness is made; and they are therefore to be regulated
and harmonized; they are not to be extinguished,
or even diminished in intensity.<a id='r726'></a><a href='#f726' class='c016'><sup>[726]</sup></a> There is a way of
so gratifying the desires that they produce a general
balance of consequences in favour of happiness; and
there is an opposite way with opposite effects. The
former is evidently the way of nature, for utility
is the only guide of conduct we have apart from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Scripture.<a id='r727'></a><a href='#f727' class='c016'><sup>[727]</sup></a> We must not eradicate any impulses; but
we must follow none so far “as to trench upon some
other law [<em>sic</em>] which equally demands our attention.”
What is the golden mean, and what is too much
or too little, we can only know by our own and
others’ experience of the consequences of actions.<a id='r728'></a><a href='#f728' class='c016'><sup>[728]</sup></a>
Nature shows us the wrongness of an act by bringing
from it a train of painful consequences. Diseases,
instead of being the “inevitable inflictions of
Providence,” are “indications that we have offended
against some of the laws of nature. The plague at
Constantinople and in other towns of the East is a
constant admonition of this kind to the inhabitants.
The human constitution cannot support such a state
of filth and torpor; and as dirt, squalid poverty, and
indolence are in the highest degree unfavourable to
happiness and virtue,<a id='r729'></a><a href='#f729' class='c016'><sup>[729]</sup></a> it seems a benevolent dispensation
that such a state should by the laws of nature
produce disease and death, as a beacon to others to
avoid splitting on the same rock.”<a id='r730'></a><a href='#f730' class='c016'><sup>[730]</sup></a> As epidemics indicate
bad food, unwholesome houses, or bad drainage,
and as indigestion follows over-eating, so the misery
that follows on too great an increase of numbers is
simply the law of nature recoiling on the law-breaker.<a id='r731'></a><a href='#f731' class='c016'><sup>[731]</sup></a>
In this case it has taken a longer experience to teach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>men the conduct most favourable to happiness, and
therefore the conduct right for them. But even the
best food, best clothing, and best housing have not
been taught all at once; and the principle of the
lesson is clearly the same in all the cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>To say, therefore, that the desire of marriage is to
be restrained and regulated is not to treat it exceptionally
or to deny its naturalness. There is a lawful
and there is an irregular gratification even of hunger
and thirst; and the irregular is punished both by
nature and, when it takes, for example, the form of
theft, by human laws. Society could give such
punishment only on the ground that the action
punished tended to injure the general happiness.
The act of the hungry man who steals a loaf is only
distinguishable from the act of the hungry man who
takes a loaf of his own, by means of its consequences.
If all were to steal loaves there would in the end be
fewer loaves for everybody.<a id='r732'></a><a href='#f732' class='c016'><sup>[732]</sup></a> We must apply the
same criterion to the irregular gratification of all
other desires.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the desire for food, the desire of marriage
is the most powerful and general of our desires.
“When we contemplate the constant and severe toil
of the greatest part of mankind, it is impossible not
to be forcibly impressed with the reflection that the
sources of human happiness would be most cruelly
diminished if the prospect of a good meal, a warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>house, and a comfortable fireside in the evening were
not incitements sufficiently vivid to give interest and
cheerfulness to the labours and privations of the
day.”<a id='r733'></a><a href='#f733' class='c016'><sup>[733]</sup></a> This desire gives strength of character to a
man in proportion as the animal element in it is
hidden away out of sight, and in proportion as the
gratification of it is won by exertion and, it may be,
by waiting. To do as Jacob did for Rachel, a man
must have some strength of character. Most of us,
in the opinion of Malthus, owe whatever of definite
plan there is in our lives to the existence of such a
central object of affection.<a id='r734'></a><a href='#f734' class='c016'><sup>[734]</sup></a> Malthus himself, it will
appear, did not marry till on the eve of becoming a
professor at the East India College, nearly a year after
these passages were written. Even in 1798 he wrote:
“Perhaps there is scarcely a man who has once
experienced the genuine delights of virtuous love,
however great his intellectual pleasures may have
been, that does not look back to the period as the
sunny spot in his whole life, where his imagination
loves to bask, which he recollects and contemplates
with the fondest regrets, and which he would most
wish to live over again.”<a id='r735'></a><a href='#f735' class='c016'><sup>[735]</sup></a> Such a passage, though
it disappeared, with other flowers of language, in the
later editions of the essay, show us that Malthus,
though wiser, was not colder than his fellow-men,
and drew his facts from experience as well as
observation, of the matters concerned.<a id='r736'></a><a href='#f736' class='c016'><sup>[736]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>If we assume the intention of the Creator to
replenish the earth, we can see a reason in cosmical
polity for the strength of this desire of marriage. If
the fertility of fertile soils had been as great as the
power of population to increase, there would have
been no inducement to men to cultivate the poorer
soils or frequent the less attractive parts of the
earth’s surface; human industry and ingenuity would
have wanted their first stimulus.<a id='r737'></a><a href='#f737' class='c016'><sup>[737]</sup></a> As it is, the
disparity of the two powers leads to an over-spreading
of the world; men are led to avoid overcrowding from
fear of the evils that spring from it. Man’s duties vary
with his situations; and, as these are not uniform, but
infinitely various, all his powers are kept in play.
This language might make us doubt whether the
final cause is the development of man, or simply the
replenishment of the earth. If the first essay be
allowed in evidence, it is clear that man (with whatever
justice) is made the chief end of the earth,
though his own chief end is not supposed to be
realized there.<a id='r738'></a><a href='#f738' class='c016'><sup>[738]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The natural theology of Malthus and Paley is the
foundation of their ethics. It was the English ethics
of last century, not only before Kant, but before
Bentham. There are signs that Malthus, in his views
of metaphysics and of the “moral sentiments,”<a id='r739'></a><a href='#f739' class='c016'><sup>[739]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>preferred where he could to draw rather from Tucker
than from Paley. Abraham Tucker<a id='r740'></a><a href='#f740' class='c016'><sup>[740]</sup></a> (the “Edward
Search” who began the <cite>Light of Nature</cite> in 1756,
and finished it, blind, in 1774) lived for nearly fifty
years<a id='r741'></a><a href='#f741' class='c016'><sup>[741]</sup></a> at Betchworth Castle near Dorking. It is
possible in these days, when near neighbours knew
each other better than they care to do now, that
Daniel Malthus, though the younger man, may have
known Tucker. They were both of them Oxford
men, small proprietors, eccentric, literary, and fond
of philosophizing. Whether through his father at
home or through Paley at college, it is certain that
Malthus at an early date studied the <cite>Light of Nature</cite>
and adopted much of its teaching. Before he appeared
in public as an author, he had formed some settled
philosophical convictions, which (whatever their value)
at least left his mind free for its other work, and
kept it at peace with itself as regards the problems
of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The substantial agreement of his views with the
doctrines of the <cite>Moral and Political Philosophy</cite> no
doubt helped to bring Malthus under the common
prejudice against “Pigeon Paley,”<a id='r742'></a><a href='#f742' class='c016'><sup>[742]</sup></a> the defender of
things as they are and preacher of contentment to
starving labourers. When Paley became an open
convert to the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>, the public would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>no doubt believe their suspicions confirmed. But
Malthus and Paley agree not as disciple and master,
but at most as disciples of the same master. Malthus
tries to work out his own philosophy for himself.<a id='r743'></a><a href='#f743' class='c016'><sup>[743]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is open to many criticisms. In his ethics he
seems to have made no distinct analysis or classification
of the passions. He takes for granted that
the Passions are on one side and Reason on the other,
and there is no middle term between the two except
the Design of God, which is worked out by the
passions of men as by external nature, and which is
(we are left to infer) in some way akin to human
reason, for human reason can find it out. The
impulse of benevolence, for example, is said to be,
like all our natural passions, “general” (by which he
seems to mean vague), “and in some degree indiscriminate
and blind;” and, like the impulses of love,
anger, ambition, the desire of eating and drinking,
or any other of our “natural propensities,” it must
be regulated by experience and frequently brought
to the test of utility, or it will defeat its own purpose.<a id='r744'></a><a href='#f744' class='c016'><sup>[744]</sup></a>
In other words, Malthus treats all human impulses
as if they were appetites, co-ordinate with each other,
primary and irresolvable. All desires are equally
natural, and abstractedly considered equally virtuous,<a id='r745'></a><a href='#f745' class='c016'><sup>[745]</sup></a>
though not equally strong, and therefore not equally
fit at first sight to carry out their Creator’s purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Reason of Man, therefore, must assist the Reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>of his Maker in carrying out the teleology of his
passions, as well as the teleology of nature itself.<a id='r746'></a><a href='#f746' class='c016'><sup>[746]</sup></a>
The “apparent object” (or evident final cause), for
example, of the desire of marriage is the continuance
of the race and the care of the weak, and not merely
the happiness of the two persona most concerned.<a id='r747'></a><a href='#f747' class='c016'><sup>[747]</sup></a>
To take another example, the object of the impulse
of benevolence is to increase the sum of human
happiness by binding the human race together.<a id='r748'></a><a href='#f748' class='c016'><sup>[748]</sup></a>
Self-love is made a stronger motive than benevolence
for a wise and perfectly ascertainable purpose. The
ascertainment of the purpose, however, presents a
difficulty. Acknowledging that we ought to do the
will of God, how are we to discover it?</p>

<p class='c007'>We are told in answer to this question, that the
intention of the Creator to procure the good of His
creatures is evident partly from Scripture and partly
from experience; and it is that intention, so manifested,
which we are bound to promote. What on
God’s side is teleology, on man’s is utility; utility is
the ruling principle of morals. Not being a passion
it cannot itself lead to action; but it regulates passion,
and that, so powerfully, that all our most important
laws and customs, such as the institution of property
and the institution of marriage, are simply disguised
forms of it.<a id='r749'></a><a href='#f749' class='c016'><sup>[749]</sup></a> As animals, we follow the dictates of
nature, which would mean unhindered passion; but as
reasonable beings we are under the strongest obligations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>to attend to the consequences of our acts, and,
if they be evil to ourselves or others, we may justly
infer that such a mode of indulging those passions is
“not suited to our state or conformable to the will of
God.” As moral agents, therefore, it is clearly our
duty to restrain the indulgence of our passions in those
particular directions, that by thus carefully examining
their consequences, and by frequently bringing them
to the test of utility, we may gradually acquire a
habit of gratifying them only in the way which, being
unattended with evil, will clearly “add to the sum
of human happiness, and fulfil the apparent purpose
of the Creator.”<a id='r750'></a><a href='#f750' class='c016'><sup>[750]</sup></a> All the moral codes which have
laid down the subjection of the passions to reason
have been really (thinks Malthus) built on this
foundation, whether their promulgators were aware
of it or not. “It is the test alone by which we can
know independently of the revealed will of God
whether a passion ought or ought not to be indulged,
and is therefore the surest criterion of modern rules
which can be collected from the light of nature.” In
other words, our theological postulates lead us to
control our passions so as to secure not merely our
own individual happiness, but “the greatest sum of
human happiness.” And the tendency of an action
to promote or diminish the general happiness is our
only criterion of its morality.<a id='r751'></a><a href='#f751' class='c016'><sup>[751]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>From this it directly follows that, because the free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>and indiscriminate indulgence of benevolence leads
to the reverse of general happiness, we ought to
practise a discriminating charity which blesses him
that gives and him that takes. There is what
Bastiat would call a harmony between the two.<a id='r752'></a><a href='#f752' class='c016'><sup>[752]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In this case, indeed, nature reinforces utility by
making the passion of self-love stronger in men than
the passion of benevolence. Every man pursues his
own happiness first as his primary object, and it is
best that he should do so. It is best that every
man should, in the first instance, work out his own
salvation, and have a sense of his own responsibility.
Not only charity but moral reformation must begin
at home. Benevolence apart from wisdom is even
more mischievous than mere self-love, which is not
to be identified with the “odious vice of selfishness,”
but simply with personal ambition, the
person to whom it is personal including as a rule
children and parents, and in fact a whole world
besides the single atom or “dividual self.”<a id='r753'></a><a href='#f753' class='c016'><sup>[753]</sup></a> If the
desire of giving to others had been as ardent as
the desire of giving to ourselves, the human race
would not have been equal to the task of providing
for all its possible members. But because it is impossible
for it to provide for all, there is a tendency
in all to provide for themselves first; and, though
we consider that the selfish element in this feeling
ought to grow less in a man in proportion as he
becomes richer and less embarrassed by his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>wants, we must recognize that its existence has been
due to a wise provision for the general happiness.<a id='r754'></a><a href='#f754' class='c016'><sup>[754]</sup></a>
Malthus does not deny at the same time that benevolence
is always the weaker motive, and needs continually
to be strengthened by doctrine, reproof, and
correction. It ought always to be thought a “great
moral duty” to assist our fellow-creatures in distress.<a id='r755'></a><a href='#f755' class='c016'><sup>[755]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>With these ethical views, it was easy for Malthus
to meet the objection that the general adoption of the
moral restraint recommended in his <cite>Essay on Population</cite>
would diminish the numbers of the people too far.
He (or his spokesman) answers<a id='r756'></a><a href='#f756' class='c016'><sup>[756]</sup></a> that we might as well
fear to teach benevolence lest we should make men too
careless of their private interests. “There is in such a
case a mean point of perfection, which it is our duty
to be constantly aiming at; and the circumstance of
this point being surrounded on all sides with dangers
is only according to the analogy of all ethical experience.”
There is as much danger of making men
too generous or too compassionate, as there is of
“depopulating the world by making them too much
the creatures of reason, and giving prudence too
great a mastery over the natural passions and affections.
The prevailing error in the game of life is,
not that we miss the prizes through excess of timidity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>but that we overlook the true state of the chances
in our eager and sanguine expectations of winning
them.<a id='r757'></a><a href='#f757' class='c016'><sup>[757]</sup></a> Of all the objections that were ever made
to a moralist who offered to arm men against the
passions that are everywhere seducing them into
misery, the most flattering, but undoubtedly the
most chimerical, is that his reasons are so strong
that, if he were allowed to diffuse them, passion
would be extinguished altogether, and the activity
as well as the enjoyments of man annihilated along
with his vices.”<a id='r758'></a><a href='#f758' class='c016'><sup>[758]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In his view of the passions and of the moral
sentiments, Malthus is clearly a man of the eighteenth
century, and on the whole is more nearly at
one with Paley than with any moralist after Tucker.
There are points of divergence. He could not, in
view of his cosmology, have fully approved Paley’s
definition of virtue, “doing good to mankind in
obedience to the will of God and for the sake of
everlasting happiness.”<a id='r759'></a><a href='#f759' class='c016'><sup>[759]</sup></a> He may have seen how it
followed that a solitary man had no duties, that a
pagan had no power to do right, that the moral
imperative was hypothetical, and that it had no force
for any who abjured their future bliss. At least he
contents himself with agreeing that “the will of God
is plainly general happiness, as we discover both by
Scripture and the light of nature;”<a id='r760'></a><a href='#f760' class='c016'><sup>[760]</sup></a> and, “provided
we discover it, it matters nothing by what means;”—there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>are clear marks of design in the world showing
that its Maker willed the happiness of His creatures;
and what He willed they should will.</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, the ethical system of both is a
utilitarianism which is narrow and personal in its
motive (the private happiness of the individual in
another world), but broad and catholic in its end
(the general happiness of human beings in the present
world). It is as if God induced us to promote other
people’s happiness now, by telling us that He would
in return promote our own by-and-by. There are
signs that Malthus took a larger view, and thought
rather of the development of the human faculties<a id='r761'></a><a href='#f761' class='c016'><sup>[761]</sup></a>
than of mere satisfaction of desires, both in this
world and in the next; but he nowhere distinctly
breaks with Paley, and his division of passions into
self-love (or prudence) and benevolence is taken
straight from that theologian.<a id='r762'></a><a href='#f762' class='c016'><sup>[762]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>By the vagueness of their phraseology when they
spoke of the general sum of happiness, the older
utilitarians avoided some of the difficulties that encounter
their successors. Apart from the hardness
of defining happiness and a sum of happiness,<a id='r763'></a><a href='#f763' class='c016'><sup>[763]</sup></a>
there is a difficulty in fixing the precise extent of
the generality. The tendency of utilitarianism in
the hands of Bentham was towards equality and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>removal of privilege; every one to count as one, no
one as more than one. But both with him and
with the older members it may be doubted whether
the doctrine did not tend to benefit the majority
at the expense of the minority.</p>

<p class='c007'>We find Malthus thinking<a id='r764'></a><a href='#f764' class='c016'><sup>[764]</sup></a> that, had the Poor
Laws never existed, there “might have been a few
more instances of very severe distress,” but “the
aggregate mass of happiness among the common
people would have been much greater than it is at
present.” In other words, what he wanted was the
“greatest amount of happiness” on the whole, whatever
an “amount” of happiness may mean. Malthus
would probably have refused to use the formula of
Bentham, “the greatest happiness of the greatest
number”; he would have counted the first item,
the happiness, out of all proportion more important
than the second.<a id='r765'></a><a href='#f765' class='c016'><sup>[765]</sup></a> He had refused something like
it at the hands of Paley. “I cannot agree with
Archdeacon Paley, who says that the quantity of
happiness in any country is best measured by the
number of its people. Increasing population is the
most certain possible sign of the happiness and
prosperity of a state; but the actual population may
be only a sign of the happiness that is past.”<a id='r766'></a><a href='#f766' class='c016'><sup>[766]</sup></a>
Malthus would not, for example, have wished to
see the highlands of Scotland brought back to their
ancient condition, in which they had greater numbers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>than now living in rude comfort, but also greater
numbers exposed to precarious indigence.<a id='r767'></a><a href='#f767' class='c016'><sup>[767]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, it is certain (in spite of a
common prejudice) that Malthus desired the great
numbers as well as the great happiness, and was
indeed quite naturally led by his theological views to
prefer a little happiness for each of many individuals
to a great deal for each of a few. He “desires a
great actual population and a state of society in
which abject poverty and dependence are comparatively
but little known,”<a id='r768'></a><a href='#f768' class='c016'><sup>[768]</sup></a>—two perfectly compatible
requirements, which if realized together would lead
to what may be called Malthus’ secondary or earthly
paradise, which is not above mundane criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>This earthly paradise is, even in our author’s
opinion, the end most visibly concerned in our
schemes of reform. His idea of it as a society where
moral restraint is perfect, invites the remark that the
chief end of society cannot be the mere removal of
evil; it must be the establishment of some good, the
former being at the utmost an essential condition <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine
quâ non</span></i> of the latter. Moreover, moral restraint is
not the removal of every but only of one evil; and it
kills only one cause of poverty. A complete reformation
must not only remove all the evils, but must
positively amend and transform all the three branches
of social economy,—the making, the sharing, and the
using of wealth,—not one or even two of them
alone. Every Utopian scheme should be tested by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>the question: Does it reform all three, or only one,
or two, of the three? Neglect of the third might
spoil all. A scheme which affects all three, however,
must have something like a Religion in it. With
these reservations Malthus’ picture of the good time
coming has much value and interest.<a id='r769'></a><a href='#f769' class='c016'><sup>[769]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Unlike Godwin, he relies on the ordinary motives
of men, which he regards as forms of an enlightened
self-love. Self-love is the mainspring of the social
machine;<a id='r770'></a><a href='#f770' class='c016'><sup>[770]</sup></a> but self-love, when the self is so expanded
as to include other selves, is not a low motive.
Commercial ambition, encouraged by political liberty,
and unhampered by Poor Laws, leads naturally to
prosperity.<a id='r771'></a><a href='#f771' class='c016'><sup>[771]</sup></a> The happiness of the whole is to result
from the happiness of individuals, and to begin first
with them. He “sees in all forms of thought and
work the life and death struggles of separate human
beings.”<a id='r772'></a><a href='#f772' class='c016'><sup>[772]</sup></a> “No co-operation is required. Every step
tells. He who performs his duty faithfully will reap
the full fruits of it, whatever may be the number of
others who fail. This duty is intelligible to the
humblest capacity. It is merely that he is not to
bring beings into the world for whom he cannot
find the means of support. When once this subject
is cleared from the obscurity thrown over it by
parochial laws and private benevolence, every man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>must feel the strongest conviction of such an obligation.
If he cannot support his children, they must
starve; and, if he marry in the face of a fair
probability that he will not be able to support his
children, he is guilty of all the evils which he thus
brings upon himself, his wife, and his offspring. It is
clearly his interest, and will tend greatly to promote
his happiness, to deter marrying till by industry and
economy he is in a capacity to support the children
that he may reasonably expect from his marriage;
and, as he cannot in the mean time gratify his
passions without violating an express command of
God, and running a great risk of injuring himself or
some of his fellow-creatures, considerations of his own
interest and happiness will dictate to him the strong
obligation to a moral conduct while he remains unmarried.”<a id='r773'></a><a href='#f773' class='c016'><sup>[773]</sup></a>
Supposing passion to be thus controlled,
we should see a very different scene from the present.
“The period of delayed gratification would be passed
in saving the earnings which were above the wants of
a single man.” Savings Banks and Friendly Societies
would have their perfect work; and “in a natural state
of society such institutions, with the aid of private
charity well directed, would probably be all the means
necessary to produce the best practicable effects.”<a id='r774'></a><a href='#f774' class='c016'><sup>[774]</sup></a>
The people’s numbers would be constantly within the
limits of the food, though constantly following its
increase; the real value of wages would be raised, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>the most permanent way possible; “all abject poverty
would be removed from society, or would at least be
confined to a very few who had fallen into misfortunes
against which no prudence or foresight could
provide.”<a id='r775'></a><a href='#f775' class='c016'><sup>[775]</sup></a> It must be brought home to the poor
that “they are themselves the cause of their own
poverty.”<a id='r776'></a><a href='#f776' class='c016'><sup>[776]</sup></a> While Malthus insists against Godwin
that it is not institutions and laws but ourselves that
are to blame, he still shares, with Godwin, the desire
to lessen the number of institutions; and, as a first
reform, would repeal at least one obnoxious law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relation of Malthus to the French Revolution
and its English partisans is indeed not to be expressed
in a sentence. It has been said that he cannot
be justly described as being a reactionary;<a id='r777'></a><a href='#f777' class='c016'><sup>[777]</sup></a> and,
in truth, besides being a critic of Godwin and of
Condorcet, he is influenced to some extent by the
same ideas that influenced them. The <cite>Essay on
Population</cite> is coloured throughout by a tacit or
open reference to the Rights of Man, a watchword
borrowed from France by the American Republic, to
be restored again at the Revolution. Paine’s book on
the <cite>Rights of Man</cite>, in reply to Burke’s <cite>Reflections on the
French Revolution</cite>, had been widely read before it was
suppressed by the English Government; and Godwin
and Mackintosh<a id='r778'></a><a href='#f778' class='c016'><sup>[778]</sup></a> were not silenced. Malthus himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>as a Whig, does not disparage the rights of man
when they meant political freedom and equality, but
only when they included the right to be supported by
one’s neighbour, as had been asserted by the Abbé
Raynal and some other writers of the Revolution.<a id='r779'></a><a href='#f779' class='c016'><sup>[779]</sup></a>
As the same assertion was practically made by the
English Poor Law, which had venerable conservative
prejudice on its side, our author’s opposition to
it was no proof that his politics were reactionary.
His economical antecedents and his political views
bound him to the French Revolution. In his range
of ideas and his habitual categories he could not
depart far from the French Economists, who had
helped to prepare the way for the Jacobins. Adam
Smith himself had felt their influence. Though he
had criticized the noble savage and the state of
nature,<a id='r780'></a><a href='#f780' class='c016'><sup>[780]</sup></a> he had himself a lingering preference for
agriculture over manufacture; and he himself spoke
of a “natural” price, a “natural” progress of opulence,
a “natural” rate of wages, and “natural
liberty.” To him as to the French writers, Nature<a id='r781'></a><a href='#f781' class='c016'><sup>[781]</sup></a>
meant what would grow of itself if men did not
interfere,—the difficulty being that the interference
seems also to grow of itself, and it is impossible to
separate the necessary protection from the mischievous
interference. Malthus retains the phraseology with
an even nearer approach to personification. Nature
points out to us certain courses of conduct.<a id='r782'></a><a href='#f782' class='c016'><sup>[782]</sup></a> If we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>break Nature’s laws, she will punish us. At Nature’s
mighty feast there is no cover laid for the superfluous
new-comer. The Poor Laws offend against
Nature; they interfere with human action in a case
where it would spontaneously right itself by ordinary
motives of self-interest; if men knew they could
not count on parish relief, they would probably help
themselves. Be the argument worth much or little,
its strength is not the greater because of this figure;
and his use of it shows that Malthus had not risen
above the metaphysical superstitions of his age. But
the charge sometimes made against him is that he
was not merely not before his age but positively
behind it; and this is certainly false.</p>

<p class='c007'>In politics he was as little of a reactionary as his
opponent, who if “in principle a Republican was in
practice a Whig.”<a id='r783'></a><a href='#f783' class='c016'><sup>[783]</sup></a> He followed Fox rather than
Burke, and lost neither his head nor his temper over
the Revolution. “Malthus will prove a peace-monger,”
wrote Southey in 1808.<a id='r784'></a><a href='#f784' class='c016'><sup>[784]</sup></a> He was a steady
friend of Catholic Emancipation. He saw the folly
of attributing with Godwin and Paine all evil to the
Government, and with Cobbett all evil to taxation
and the funds;<a id='r785'></a><a href='#f785' class='c016'><sup>[785]</sup></a> but he is one with them all in
dislike of standing armies, and is more alarmed at
the overbearing measures of the Government against
sedition than at the alleged sedition itself. One of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>the most remarkable chapters in the second edition
of the essay<a id='r786'></a><a href='#f786' class='c016'><sup>[786]</sup></a> is on “the effects of the knowledge of
the principal cause of poverty on civil liberty.”  Its
main argument is, that, where there is much distress
and destitution, there will be much discontent and
sedition, and, where there is much of the two last,
there will be much coercion and despotism. A knowledge
of the chief cause of poverty by taking away the
distress would leave Government at least no excuse
for tyranny. “The pressure of distress on the lower
classes of people, together with the habit of attributing
this distress to their rulers, appears to me to be the
rock of defence, the castle, the guardian spirit of
despotism. It affords to the tyrant the fatal and
unanswerable plea of necessity. It is the reason why
every free Government tends constantly to destruction,
and that its appointed guardians become daily less
jealous of the encroachments of power.”<a id='r787'></a><a href='#f787' class='c016'><sup>[787]</sup></a> The French
people had been told that their unhappiness was due
to their rulers; they overthrew their rulers, and,
finding their distress not removed, they sacrificed the
new rulers; and this process would have continued
indefinitely if despotism had not been found preferable
to anarchy. In England “the Government of
the last twenty years<a id='r788'></a><a href='#f788' class='c016'><sup>[788]</sup></a> has shown no great love of
peace or liberty,”  and the country gentlemen have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>apparently surrendered themselves to Government on
condition of being protected from the mob.<a id='r789'></a><a href='#f789' class='c016'><sup>[789]</sup></a> A few
more scarcities like 1800 might cause such convulsions
and lead to such sternness of repression that the
British constitution would end as Hume foretold,<a id='r790'></a><a href='#f790' class='c016'><sup>[790]</sup></a>
in “absolute monarchy, the easiest death, the true
<em>euthanasia</em> of the British constitution.” The “tendency
of mobs to produce tyranny” can only be
counteracted by the subversion, not of the tyrants, but
of the mobs. The result would be a lean and wiry
people, weak for offence, but strong for defence; there
would be freedom at home and peace abroad.<a id='r791'></a><a href='#f791' class='c016'><sup>[791]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Of course the “knowledge of the principal cause
of poverty” is not conceived by Malthus as the only
lesson worth learning. He shares the growing
enthusiasm of all friends of the people for popular
education,<a id='r792'></a><a href='#f792' class='c016'><sup>[792]</sup></a> and thinks the Tory arguments against
instructing the poorer classes “not only illiberal,
but to the last degree feeble, if not really disingenuous.”<a id='r793'></a><a href='#f793' class='c016'><sup>[793]</sup></a>
“An instructed and well-informed people
would be much less likely to be led away by
inflammatory writings, and much better able to
detect the false declamation of interested and ambitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>demagogues than an ignorant people.”<a id='r794'></a><a href='#f794' class='c016'><sup>[794]</sup></a> These
words were written in 1803, four years before
Whitbread made his motion on Schools and Savings
Banks, and thirteen years before Brougham’s Committee
on Education.<a id='r795'></a><a href='#f795' class='c016'><sup>[795]</sup></a> Malthus in fact was in politics
an advanced Whig, ahead of his party in ideas of
social reform. This may be seen from the following
passage, which is only one out of many, that show
his large view of his subject. He says that in
most countries among the poor there seems to be
something like “a standard of wretchedness, a point
below which they will not continue to marry.” “This
standard is different in different countries, and is
formed by various concurring circumstances of soil,
climate, government, degree of knowledge, civilization,
&amp;c.” It is raised by liberty, security of property,
the diffusion of knowledge, and a taste for the conveniences
and the comforts of life. It is lowered by
despotism and ignorance. “In an attempt to better
the condition of the labouring classes of society, our
object should be to raise this standard as high as
possible by cultivating a spirit of independence, a
decent pride, and a taste for cleanliness and comfort.
The effect of a good Government in increasing the prudential
habits and personal respectability of the lower
classes of society has already been insisted on; but
certainly this effect will always be incomplete without
a good system of education, and indeed it may be said
that no Government can approach to perfection that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>does not provide for the instruction of the people.
The benefits derived from education are among those
which may be enjoyed without restriction of numbers;
and, as it is in the power of Governments to confer
these benefits, it is undoubtedly their duty to do it.”<a id='r796'></a><a href='#f796' class='c016'><sup>[796]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Our author’s historical sense saved him from Ricardian
presumptions in favour of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</span></i>. Writers
go too far, however, in declaring unlimited competition
to be against the spirit of his work, and
asserting that he undervalued the influence of institutions,
only that he might save his country’s institutions
from hasty reform.<a id='r797'></a><a href='#f797' class='c016'><sup>[797]</sup></a> He knew that society did
not grow up on economical principles; instead of
beginning with non-interference, and extending interference
by degrees where it was found imperative, it
began with interference everywhere, and relaxed the
interference by degrees where it was found possible
and thought desirable. We have begun with status
and paternal government, and have made our way
towards contract and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</span></i>; but we have never
reached them, because, as men now are, we cannot go
on without damage to the common weal. But it
seemed to Malthus that experience had shown the
need as clearly as the dangers of natural liberty;—history,
for example, had clearly proved that the
material relief of the poor, which had never been
abandoned by the Government, might best have been
left to private action. The extreme view would have
been that it was not every one’s duty in general, but
every one’s in particular, a responsibility of which no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>one could divest himself. But, though Malthus often
speaks as if the burden ought to lie specially on a man’s
relatives and private friends, he does not share Adam
Smith’s antipathy to associations, and would probably
have recognized division of labour to be as necessary
in charity as in industry. Still, even as administered
by an organization of men specially fitted for the
work by nature and choice, the distribution of
material relief never seems to him a case where
society can help the poor without in some degree
injuring their independence and their strength of
character. In the matter of charity he is clearly on
the side of natural liberty and individualism.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, in other directions, he has made admissions
which seriously modify the unlimited competition of
natural liberty. He admits, first of all, that the
struggle for existence when it is the struggle for
bare life does not lead to progress;<a id='r798'></a><a href='#f798' class='c016'><sup>[798]</sup></a> and he admits,
therefore, in the second place, that the state should
interfere with the “system of natural liberty,” positively,
to educate the citizens,<a id='r799'></a><a href='#f799' class='c016'><sup>[799]</sup></a> and to grant medical
aid to the poor,<a id='r800'></a><a href='#f800' class='c016'><sup>[800]</sup></a> to assist emigration,<a id='r801'></a><a href='#f801' class='c016'><sup>[801]</sup></a> and even to
give direct relief in money to men that have a family
of more than six children,<a id='r802'></a><a href='#f802' class='c016'><sup>[802]</sup></a>—as well as negatively, to
restrict foreign trade when it causes more harm to
the public than good to the traders,<a id='r803'></a><a href='#f803' class='c016'><sup>[803]</sup></a> and to restrict
the home trade where children’s labour is concerned.<a id='r804'></a><a href='#f804' class='c016'><sup>[804]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>A critic might ask on what principle he justifies
these admissions; or might hint that he makes them
on no conscious principle at all, but in the spirit of
a judge, who is administering a law that he knows
to be bad, but prefers to make continual exceptions
rather than suggest a new law;—otherwise could
any rule stand the test of so many exceptions?</p>

<p class='c007'>It might be replied that Malthus nowhere writes a
treatise on political philosophy, and his views must be
inferred from scattered hints, but it does not follow
that he was not, consciously or unconsciously, possessed
of a guiding principle. His several admissions
have a certain logical connection. It is more doubtful
whether their connecting principle will seem adequate
to a modern reader whose questions in political philosophy
have been stated for him by Comte and the
latter-day socialists.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first of the admissions is the more significant,
as Malthus, while making it, refuses to approve of
the means then actually adopted (by the Poor Law)
for raising the level of the weakest citizens, and so
fitting them for their struggle. If the absence of
provision was an evil, the existing provision was
hardly a less one. It was bad for society to give
help by giving bread and butter, for that was a gift
to full-grown men and women, not really weak, but
quite ready to be indolent. A gift of education,
on the other hand, is given, he considers, to those
who are really incapable of helping themselves and
really ignorant of their powers.<a id='r805'></a><a href='#f805' class='c016'><sup>[805]</sup></a> It makes the weak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>strong, and tends to remove indolence, not create
it.<a id='r806'></a><a href='#f806' class='c016'><sup>[806]</sup></a> In the same way Factory Acts assist the weak
and not the indolent, while the (rare) interference
with free trade, the granting of medical relief, the
special aid in case of large families, and the aid to
Irish peasants, are all of them special remedies in
cases where the sufferers could not be expected to
foresee and provide against the distress, and were
therefore sufferers from circumstances rather than from
indolence. Malthus continually takes the view that
security is a greater blessing than wealth itself, and
insecurity a worse evil than poverty. The circumstances
that cause insecurity were therefore in his view
the most distressing; they baffled individual effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>His critics might have answered: “In all the cases
mentioned by you as justifying interference, a perfectly
enlightened self-interest would have provided
against the mishap; and relief of any kind would be
in the end equivalent to relief in bread and butter,
for, as far as it goes, it allows the more to be left over
either to the man or his parents for bread and butter,
and thereby it is a relief that fosters indolence.” He
could rejoin, however, that (even if we grant the
practical possibility of such a perfect enlightenment)
direct relief appeals far more to indolence than indirect,<a id='r807'></a><a href='#f807' class='c016'><sup>[807]</sup></a>
and the good of the indirect can often, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>good of the direct very seldom, outweigh the evil. He
would have added that even the direct relief in bread
and butter was not opposed by him on any theory,
but on the ground of its known tendency to evil,—and,
if it had been possible from the nature of men
and things to keep the promises of the Poor Law,
he would have given his voice for it. He was committed
to free trade itself only because and only so
far as experience was in its favour. His only axiom
in political philosophy was that the end of politics
is the greatest happiness of the great body of the
people; and his only rule for securing that end was
the observation of what, as a matter of experience,
actually did secure it.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, nothing is clearer from his own
writings than that the language of experience owes
much of its meaning to its interpreter; and we ask
“What were his principles of interpretation?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer is, that, in spite of the affinity between
utilitarianism in morals and individualism in politics,
he tried to retain the first without the second. He
understood moral goodness to consist in the tendency
of actions to produce a balance of pleasures over
pains; but his utility when examined turned out, as
we have seen, to be much nearer the notion of self-development
than simply a sum of pleasures irrespective
of their quality. At this point the strong
grasp which family life held on his fancy lifted him
above the notion that the chief end could be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>individual happiness of isolated units, and showed
him that the real unit was a group. The state to
Malthus, as to Aristotle, is an aggregate of families,
though he recognizes very clearly that, besides the
connection of householder with householder by the
common subjection to the laws, there is the common
bond of nationality, a community of feeling, a partnership
of past traditions, present privileges, and future
hopes.<a id='r808'></a><a href='#f808' class='c016'><sup>[808]</sup></a> It is one of the plainest facts of experience
that men are often led by their attachment to their
country and countrymen to run counter to their
worldly interests.<a id='r809'></a><a href='#f809' class='c016'><sup>[809]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The nation is a little world within the great world,
and on the analogy of the great world it is the scene
where difficulties generate talents and bring out the
character.<a id='r810'></a><a href='#f810' class='c016'><sup>[810]</sup></a> From this point of view it is not far
from the truth to parody a well-known description
of modern Judaism, and describe the political philosophy
of Malthus as Utilitarianism <em>plus</em> a Nationality.
The individualism of Malthus is limited by
the particular institutions and particular interests of
the English nation.<a id='r811'></a><a href='#f811' class='c016'><sup>[811]</sup></a> In his intellectual history a
strong emphasis on the state preceded the emphasis on
the individual; and even in his mature view the state
is limited in its interference with the citizens only
by its powers of doing good to them. But he holds
with Adam Smith and the other economists that its
powers of doing good to them are very much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>narrower than on the old conception of the state, as
a kind of family. The duties of a state to the
citizens are narrower than those of a father to his
children, because what the father can and must do
for his children the state cannot do for its citizens
with equal safety to their independence. It remains,
however, true that the relation of state to citizen is
not the commercial relation of one contracting party
with another; it is a relation prior to the commercial,
and gives to all contracts whatever validity they
have.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Malthus himself had been asked to reconcile
his departure from the general principle of natural
liberty with his general adherence to it, he would
have made some such answer as the following:
“From the first, when I wrote in 1798, it appeared
to me that the action of Government could neither
have so uniformly bad an effect as Godwin supposed,
nor so uniformly good as Pitt’s Bill implied. If, as
Godwin desires, there were no Government, but only
a chastened <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</span></i>, unsophisticated human
nature would be quite enough to bring back misery
and sin.<a id='r812'></a><a href='#f812' class='c016'><sup>[812]</sup></a> But the chastening of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</span></i>
could not in my opinion take place without the
Government, for it is one of the most proper functions
of Government, not adequately dischargeable by individuals,
to provide for the people the education
that is supposed to chasten. Even when that provision
has been made, the education will not do its
perfect work if it has not included the particular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>doctrines which it has fallen to me more than any
man to bring home to the public mind. With such
an education there will be hope for better things.
Things as they are and the struggle for existence as
it now is among the helpless classes can please me
as little as Godwin. It is a struggle which leads to
no progress. But, unlike Godwin, I do not regard
Government as necessarily creating the distress; and
I certainly regard it as the necessary engine for
removing the distress by education in the end, and
toning down its effects by restrictions for the present.
If only as an engine of education, paternal
government must be a permanent factor of society.
Where a public necessity has been well supplied by
individual action, I should leave it in the hands of
individuals; but not otherwise. I did not object to
the Poor Law on the broad ground that it took the
place of private action, but because its own action
was mischievous. I should try every case on its
merits, and be guided to interfere or not interfere
by the known results of the existing policies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In so speaking, Malthus would no doubt have
justified his own consistency. But the modern reader
might justly reply to Malthus, that we have often to
judge tendencies as well as results, and experience
becomes then an uncertain guide; he might complain
that Malthus himself is sometimes led to judge both
of them by a half-acknowledged supplementary principle
of the balance of classes and safety of the
mean, which can be applied in a way very unfavourable
to popular rights. He might urge that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>apparent success of an institution might have been
due to a concurrent cause that cancelled its defects,
and we cannot always pronounce on its merits from
experience of it. How can experience help us unless
we have the key to its interpretation? Without
such a key nothing would be so false as facts except
figures. In human politics mere survival is seldom
the test of fitness.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we compare the state to an organism and convert
our simile into a rule of judgment, we may say that,
when each part has its function and contributes to
the efficiency of the whole, the body politic is well;
when any part does not, there is need of the doctor
or surgeon. This figure seems to give us a key for
the interpretation of social experience; but unhappily
the figure itself needs an interpreter.<a id='r813'></a><a href='#f813' class='c016'><sup>[813]</sup></a> If we interpret
organism as the ideal union of members in one
body, it ceases to be a simile, for the body politic is
not merely like this union,—it is the best example of
it. For in the body politic the general life is the
source of all individual energy, and at the same time
the individual members are continually paying back
the debt, by an active sympathy and conscious union
with the commonwealth, to which the commonwealth
in its turn owes all its collective energy; the citizen
is nothing without his state, or the state without its
citizens. This is to make the figure useful, by making
it change places with the thing prefigured. So long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>as the same idea is grasped in both, their relation in
rhetoric need not affect us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such an idea of the state would lead us beyond the
admissions of Malthus to some such demands as the
following:—For his every possession, the citizen must
be able to show some service rendered to his countrymen,
and must be taught and expected to hold his
property in trust for the common good, that so the
body politic may have no useless member. In proportion
as private possession involves monopoly,
its use should be jealously restricted in the public
interest, which in the extreme cases would lead to
the withdrawing of it, with as little friction as might
be, from the private owner to the state. Education
acts, sanitary laws, and factory acts should be
strictly and universally enforced, not for the sake
of the parents, guardians, and employers, or even
altogether for the sake of the sufferers themselves,
but for the sake of the community, in order that in
the struggle for existence every competitor should
start fair as an efficient citizen, with full possession of
his powers of mind and body. For the rest, security
and order should be the watchword of the state, free
course being allowed to commercial and industrial
enterprise, scientific inquiry, and speculative discussion,
in order that progress may be made in the
surest of all ways, by the moral and intellectual
development of the individual citizens, which will
soon express itself in their institutions. With these
postulates, half from the old economists and half
from the new reformers, on the way to be realized,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>and with industrial co-operation in prospect, we need
not despair of the future of man on our part of
the earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tried by such a standard Malthus certainly fails
to give us a perfect political philosophy, and seems
little farther advanced than his master Adam Smith,
who taught that the state was profitable only for
defence, for justice, and for such public works as
could not be so well done by individuals. With all
his regard for the nation, Malthus looks at social
problems too much from the individual’s point of
view. He speaks much, for example, of the good
effect, on the individual man, of the domestic ideal,
and of the ideals of personal prosperity in the world,
both built on security of property and liberty of
action. He speaks little of the duty of the citizen
to the community, and of the return he owes it for
his security and liberty. The citizen in his picture of
him seems to have nothing but duties to his family
and nothing but claims on the state. The citizen is
lost in the householder. He is content to be let
alone, and does not positively and actively recognize
his identity with the legislative power, and his obligation
to repay service with service. Later political
philosophy would press the counter-claims of the community
on the citizen. It would demand, for example,
that he shall neither leave his lands waste nor preserve
his game, if either practice is contrary to the public
good. It would keep in mind that the holders of
large fortunes owe more to the public for protection
of them than the holders of small, and should bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>a heavier burden of taxes. It would not leave men
to do as they willed with their own.<a id='r814'></a><a href='#f814' class='c016'><sup>[814]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to the lowest classes that are hardly to
be called citizens, for they are struggling in hopeless
weakness for mere bread, Malthus never seems to
see that his own acknowledgment of their powerlessness
to rise must justify much more than the
mere establishment of compulsory education for their
children or even mechanics’ institutes for themselves.
It would justify the adoption of such measures as will
make their surroundings likely to give and preserve to
them a higher standard of living. It would sanction
measures of “local option” to keep away from them
the infection of dangerous moral diseases; and it
would enforce the obligation on the owners of houses
to make them habitable and healthy. It would give
town and country tenants secure tenure by law,
where an insecure tenure of custom had induced
them to spend labour on their holdings.</p>

<p class='c007'>The older economists had the just idea that security
in possession was the first condition of industrial
progress; but they did not see that this very
principle would justify very large restrictions on
the use of property, and that the restrictions would
increase in largeness as the property approached the
nature of a monopoly; they did not see that for the
public interest it may be as necessary to prohibit
deer forests as to pull down unsanitary dwellings or
enforce vaccination.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>The reason was that for a long time in England it
was a hard enough task for reformers to secure the
negative freedom of being let alone, the freedom of
trade and of the press and of local government, with
the abolition of privileges. Cobden’s attempt to
resolve Politics into Economics was well-timed and
fruitful in its generation; and the Manchester school
has still a part to play in our own time. But the
special work of political reform in the future is to
achieve the positive freedom, “the maximum of
power, for all members of human society alike, to
make the best of themselves.”<a id='r815'></a><a href='#f815' class='c016'><sup>[815]</sup></a> Of this programme
neither Malthus nor any writer of his day had any
clear conception. He himself had no claim to a
seer’s vision; and the horizon of his opponents was
never wider than his own.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is time to go back to the <cite>Essay</cite> and confront
its opponents. We have now a sufficient knowledge
of the economics and philosophy of Malthus to be
able to sympathize with him under misconception, or
at least to understand what appearance an objection
would wear to his mind. Not that we have a
complete picture of the man, or even a view of his
entire mental furniture, which is more than this <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">curta
supellex</span></i>; but we see enough to judge the cause of the
<cite>Essay</cite> on its merits, not prejudiced, favourably or
unfavourably, by the life and character of the author.</p>

<p class='c006'>The critics of Malthus had three questions before
them: Do the conclusions of Malthus follow from
his premises? Does he himself draw them? Are
they true as a matter of fact? The answers will
be best given by a short survey of the principal
critics with whom Malthus contended in his lifetime,
and those who have most formidably contended with
his followers since his death.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a sense in which the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>

with the question of human perfectibility. The relations
of Malthus and Godwin are as it were the tale
on which the play is founded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Godwin’s <cite>Political Justice</cite> was written in 1793, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span><cite>Enquirer</cite> in 1797, and Malthus’ <cite>Essay</cite> in 1798.
Others kept the ball a-rolling. On the Easter Tuesday
of 1800 Dr. Samuel Parr preached an anniversary
sermon in Christ’s Hospital before the Corporation of
London. He chose his text from Galatians vi. 10:
“As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good
unto all men, especially unto them who are of the
household of faith.” Like Butler’s sermons in the
Rolls Chapel, the discourse was really a treatise on
moral philosophy. It began by contrasting the selfish
and the benevolent system of ethics, pronouncing
both of them faulty. If the one has done less harm,
the other has done less good than might have been
expected, for it has been connected with the new
doctrine of universal philanthropy. The new doctrine
is false because local neighbourhood of all men is
impossible, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi terminorum</span></i>, and a widening out of the
feelings that usually prevail between local neighbours
would only make those feelings thin and watery.<a id='r816'></a><a href='#f816' class='c016'><sup>[816]</sup></a>
Man’s obligations cannot be stretched beyond his
powers; he has no powers, and therefore no obligation
to do good unto all men.<a id='r817'></a><a href='#f817' class='c016'><sup>[817]</sup></a> Love of the universe, in
the intense sense of the word love, can only belong
to the omnipotent Being who has the care of the
universe upon Him. We, being men, must only see
to it that our benevolence is of His quality, extending,
like His, to the unthankful and to the evil. But
a universal philanthropist exaggerates and pampers
this one particular form of the duty of benevolence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>at the expense of the rest, and forgets duties that lie
near to him, towards kindred and friends and neighbours;
he neglects common duties of life in favour of
the uncommon and fanciful. Very different is “the
calm desire of general happiness,” which draws those
that are near still nearer, and makes us value and
assist the benevolent institutions, like Christ’s Hospital,
which are at our own doors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hearers of the sermon could have no doubt at
whom it was aimed; and the footnotes of the published
version of it contained large quotations from
the <cite>Essay on Population</cite> and large direct commendations
of its author, which made the sermon’s oblique
censure of Godwin the more stinging.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pulpit philosophizing was not rare in those times;
it had been practised since Butler’s days by Dr. Ezra
Styles<a id='r818'></a><a href='#f818' class='c016'><sup>[818]</sup></a> in 1761; and Dr. Richard Price had used a
dissenter’s pulpit to utter his enthusiastic views on
the future improvement of mankind (1787) and the
love of our country (1789).<a id='r819'></a><a href='#f819' class='c016'><sup>[819]</sup></a> Burke had denounced
him for this in his <cite>Reflections</cite>;<a id='r820'></a><a href='#f820' class='c016'><sup>[820]</sup></a> but, if Parr could
do the same thing on the other side a few years
afterwards, it cannot have been any great singularity.
Parr’s sermon was the subject of Sydney Smith’s
first paper in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> (Oct 1802);
but its economical interest is due to its effect on
Godwin. Godwin had been assailed shortly before by
Sir James Mackintosh, a former friend and political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>ally, in his <cite>Discourse on the Law of Nature and
Nations</cite>, delivered in Lincoln’s Inn Hall, 1799; but
Dr. Parr’s censures were more severe. Parr may
have been alienated by an offensive description in
the <cite>Enquirer</cite><a id='r821'></a><a href='#f821' class='c016'><sup>[821]</sup></a> of the clergy, as characterized by “a
perennial stationariness of understanding, abortive
learning, artificial manners, infantine prejudices, and
arrogant infallibility.” As all the other professions
were equally well abused, the censure need not have
been taken to heart. The letter of Malthus to
Godwin, written after the publication of the <cite>Enquirer</cite>,
is full of courtesy. At that time, and indeed for a
few years afterwards, there was nothing but good-will
between the two writers. When Godwin in 1801
made his letters to his three critics into a book,<a id='r822'></a><a href='#f822' class='c016'><sup>[822]</sup></a> under
the title, <cite>Thoughts on Dr. Parr’s Spital Sermon</cite>, with
remarks on Mackintosh and the writer of the <cite>Essay on
Population</cite>, he was bitter only against the two former.
He was surprised at the “overbearing scornfulness”
of Mackintosh, and at the “venom” of Dr. Parr.
If he had changed some of his views it was not in
deference to their criticism. Of the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>,
“and the spirit in which it is written,” he “can
never speak but with unfeigned respect;” contending
only that it is meant to attack his conclusions and
not his premises.<a id='r823'></a><a href='#f823' class='c016'><sup>[823]</sup></a> Parr had hailed it as a complete
demonstration that Godwin’s scheme of equality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>would not work, and many better men had felt their
mouths shut, and had begged Godwin to speak for
them. Godwin consents in these <cite>Thoughts</cite>. If he
was sincere in saying, “I confess I could not see
that the essay had any very practical bearing on my
own hopes” (p. 55), he must have been in the state
which the <cite>Enquirer</cite> ascribes to the clergyman: “He
lives in the midst of evidence and is insensible to it.
He is in daily contemplation of contradictions and
finds them consistent. He listens to arguments that
would impress conviction upon every impartial hearer
and is astonished at their futility. He never dares
trust himself to one unprejudiced contemplation. He
starts with impatience and terror from its possible
result.” Malthus, on the other hand, though in
orders, has behaved very unlike the clergyman of the
<cite>Enquirer</cite>, for we are told by Godwin himself, “he has
neither laboured to excite hatred nor contempt against
me and my tenets; he has argued the questions
between us just as if they had never been made a
theme for political party and the intrigues of faction;
he has argued just as if he had no end in view but
the investigation of evidence and the development
of truth” (p. 55 ft.). Moreover, he has “made as
unquestionable an addition to the theory of political
economy as any writer for a century past. The
grand propositions and outlines of his work will, I
believe, be found not less conclusive and certain than
they are new. For myself, I cannot refuse to take
some pride in so far as by my writings I gave the
occasion and furnished an incentive to the producing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>so valuable a treatise” (p. 56). Surely concession
could no further go. Godwin even admits the arithmetical
and geometrical ratios.<a id='r824'></a><a href='#f824' class='c016'><sup>[824]</sup></a> His criticisms are
all on the checks, which (be it remembered) were
only the checks of the first essay, vice, misery, and
the fear of them. Are Governments henceforward to
prevent the evils of an excessive population by
encouraging these unsightly counter-agents? and is
every scheme for the amelioration of man’s lot foredoomed?
No, the “author of the essay” has too
small an idea of the resources of the human mind;
it is no conclusive argument against a scheme to say
that when it is realized it will probably not last.<a id='r825'></a><a href='#f825' class='c016'><sup>[825]</sup></a>
He does not attach sufficient weight to the fact that
in England, for example, “prudence and pride”
prevent early marriages, and from late ones come
smaller families. In a state of universal improvement
there would be not less but more of these feelings,
and a similar effect would follow in a greater degree.<a id='r826'></a><a href='#f826' class='c016'><sup>[826]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>That there was force in this reasoning appears from
the way in which Malthus received it when stated
to him by letter a few months after the publication
of the essay. He replied that the “prudence” in
question, if existing in Godwin’s new society, would
mean an eye to the main chance; it would mean that
one man is strengthening his position and getting to
himself more than the minimum of necessaries; if
you prevent this, what becomes of your freedom? if
you do not, what becomes of your equality and
wealth? Secondly, the effect of the prudence would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>be that the population would not be the greatest
possible, but considerably within the limits of the
food; and yet you object to present society, that its
arrangements prevent the “greatest practicable population.”
In all our political theories, if we would
trace to particular institutions the evil that is really
due to them, we must deduct the evil that is known
to be due to other causes. “The very admission of
the necessity of prudence to prevent the misery from
an overcharged population, removes the blame from
public institutions to the conduct of individuals.
And certain it is, that almost under the worst form
of government, where there was any tolerable freedom
of competition, the race of labourers, by not marrying,
and consequently decreasing their numbers, might
immediately better their condition, and under the
very best form of government, by marrying and
greatly increasing their numbers they would immediately
make their condition worse.”<a id='r827'></a><a href='#f827' class='c016'><sup>[827]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This was no doubt a point against Godwin, but it
was also a point against Malthus himself. The essay
in its first form had not made sufficient allowance for
“prudence”; and the introduction of moral restraint
in the second edition might very plausibly have been
ascribed by Godwin’s friends to Godwin himself, in
spite of the elaborate reply to the <cite>Thoughts</cite> in a
chapter afterwards dropped.<a id='r828'></a><a href='#f828' class='c016'><sup>[828]</sup></a> Godwin said to him
afterwards that he had no right to introduce a new
element into his solution of the problem, and pretend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>that it was the same solution as before;<a id='r829'></a><a href='#f829' class='c016'><sup>[829]</sup></a> if he altered
his premises he ought to alter his conclusion. To
which Malthus might have answered, that, though
his conclusion is altered, it retains its value as an
argument against Godwin. At first the tendency of
numbers to increase up to the food was described as
an obstacle fatal to progress; now it is indeed an
obstacle which must be faced and overcome, but it is
fatal not to progress, but only to equality. Godwin
himself had at first considered it an entirely imaginary
obstacle which might be ignored for the present by
reformers; and his very doctrine of prudence amounts
to an admission that his view of it had changed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Godwin himself was not conscious of his change of
front; as the seventh of thirteen children he may
have thought the matter personal; and whatever
concessions he had made in 1801 he withdrew in
1820. In that year, with David Booth, the patient
author of the <cite>English Analytical Dictionary</cite>, to arrange
his statistics and vouch for his calculations, he published
an elaborate reply to the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>.
The politicians, the political economists, the bulk
of the press, and the public had accepted the Malthusian
doctrines, though the conversion of the public
was no deeper than it was on Free Trade, and the
statesmen with a few exceptions were not sorry to
make capital out of the “odiousness” of the doctrines
whenever the “acknowledged truth” of them would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>not serve their turn. Still it seemed true that time
had declared for Malthus, and Godwin had fallen out
of notice. Sydney Smith’s assertion,<a id='r830'></a><a href='#f830' class='c016'><sup>[830]</sup></a> “Malthus took
the trouble of refuting him, and we hear no more of
Mr. Godwin,” is not very far from the truth. Malthus
had survived his refutation, and Godwin his reputation.
Pitt, Paley, and Copleston were with Malthus;
he had gained over Hallam among historians, James
Mill, Senior, and Ricardo among economists, Brougham,
Mackintosh, and even Whitbread among politicians.
Southey, Hazlitt, and Cobbett were not a
sufficient make-weight. Hazlitt in his <cite>Reply</cite> to the
<cite>Essay on Population</cite> (in letters of which some appeared
in Cobbett’s <cite>Pol. Register</cite>, 1807) acknowledges the
popularity, though he predicts its decay.<a id='r831'></a><a href='#f831' class='c016'><sup>[831]</sup></a> It seems
clear that in educated circles at least the view of
Malthus was as early as 1820 what it was in 1829,
“the popular view,”<a id='r832'></a><a href='#f832' class='c016'><sup>[832]</sup></a> which is quite compatible,
as Darwin long experienced, with great unpopularity
in particular quarters. No better evidence could be
given of this popularity than the unwilling testimony
given by Godwin himself in his new book.<a id='r833'></a><a href='#f833' class='c016'><sup>[833]</sup></a> At the
end of 1819 Brougham had referred in the House of
Commons to the principle of Malthus as “one of the
soundest principles of political economy,” and said it
was melancholy to observe how the press scouted it
and abused its defenders.<a id='r834'></a><a href='#f834' class='c016'><sup>[834]</sup></a> The press, however, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>divided. The <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> from the first had
sided with Malthus. The <cite>Quarterly</cite> had begun by
strong hostility (Dec. 1812, pp. 320 <em>seq.</em>); had softened
its tone as time went on (Dec. 1813, pp. 157 <em>seq.</em>,
and Oct. 1814, pp. 154–5); had spoken with hesitation
and doubtfulness (Oct. 1816, pp. 50 <em>seq.</em>); and had
at last completely surrendered (July 1817, pp. 369
<em>seq.</em>), confessing it to be “much easier to disbelieve
Mr. Malthus than to refute him” (p. 396), thereafter
utilizing his doctrine for the support of things as
they are, only regretting that Malthus himself would
not do the same a little more stoutly (pp. 402–3).
Finally, as we have seen, Malthus, after having contributed
to the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, became a contributor to the
<cite>Quarterly</cite>. The change of public opinion, illustrated
by the conversion of the <cite>Quarterly</cite>, gave greater
bitterness to the attacks of the enemies that remained
unconverted. But it gave them no new arguments.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Godwin’s <cite>Enquiry concerning Population</cite> (when
we neglect mere epigrams such as “a man is surer
that he has ancestors than that he will have posterity”)
there are substantially four arguments:—Malthus
has changed his position; the world is
not peopled; the ratios are not as he represents;
and experience is against him. We have already discussed
the first. The use of the second implies a
misunderstanding of the Malthusian position, for it
ignores distinction between actual and possible supplies
of food, and does not allow that a man is
“confined” by four walls unless he touches them.<a id='r835'></a><a href='#f835' class='c016'><sup>[835]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>Godwin does not mend the argument by comparing
it to the objection brought against Christianity—“the
world is not yet Christianized”; still less by appealing
to Christianity itself, and taunting Malthus with the
texts, “Increase and multiply,” “Happy is the man
that hath his quiver full of them,” “made a little
lower than the angels,” “forty sons and thirty grandsons,
which rode on threescore and ten ass colts,”
“In the last days some shall depart from the faith,
forbidding to marry.”<a id='r836'></a><a href='#f836' class='c016'><sup>[836]</sup></a> Malthus had been attacked
in 1807 by a Puritan or Covenanting pamphlet entitled,
‘A summons of Wakening, or the evil tendency
and danger of Speculative Philosophy, exemplified
in Mr. [Sir John] Leslie’s <cite>Enquiry into the Nature of
Heat</cite>, and Mr. Malthus’ <cite>Essay on Population</cite>, and in
that speculative system of common law which is at
present administered in these kingdoms.’<a id='r837'></a><a href='#f837' class='c016'><sup>[837]</sup></a> The body
of this book had been even more remarkable than its
title, for it had proved Malthus guilty not merely
of heterodoxy, but of atheism. “It is evident to
any one who attentively reads the <cite>Essay on Population</cite>
that its author does not believe in the existence of
God, but substitutes for Him sometimes the principle
of Population, sometimes that of Necessity.” Sadler
many years later declared in the same spirit that “the
insults the theory of Malthus levels at God, and the
injuries it meditates inflicting upon man, will be
endured by neither.”<a id='r838'></a><a href='#f838' class='c016'><sup>[838]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Once for all, let Parson Malthus explain his consistency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>with the religious text-book of his Church.
Prior to the injunction given to men to increase
and multiply, come, says Malthus, all the moral and
physical laws without which they cannot increase or
multiply. Suppose the command had been to increase
and multiply not men but vegetables; this could not
mean, “Sow the seed broadcast, in the air, over the
sea, on stony ground,” but, “Take all the means
made necessary, by pre-existing laws, to secure the
best growth of vegetables.” That man would best
obey the command, who should prepare the soil, and
provide for the watering and tilling of it, where those
things were wanting before. So he will best obey the
command to increase and multiply Men, who prepares
food for men where there was none before, and not he
who brings them recklessly into the world without
any such provision. “I believe it is the intention of
the Creator that the earth should be replenished, but
certainly with a healthy, virtuous, and happy population,
not an unhealthy, vicious, and miserable one.
And, if, in endeavouring to obey the command to
increase and multiply, we people it only with beings
of the latter description and suffer accordingly, we
have no right to impeach the justice of the command,
but our irrational mode of executing it.”<a id='r839'></a><a href='#f839' class='c016'><sup>[839]</sup></a> He might
have added, that to give any other interpretation of
the passage in Genesis is to forget the circumstances
in which the words were spoken. The Deluge had
just swept away all the earth’s inhabitants except one
family, expressly on the score of wickedness; and, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>a wicked replenishing were not desirable, an unhappy
or a poor one would be at the best only one
degree less so. Regarding the question then purely
from the outside, we cannot find anything in the writings
of Parson Malthus inconsistent with his ecclesiastical
orthodoxy; and we can hardly believe that free-thinking
Godwin was very serious in the objection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malthus himself replies to it as a charge commonly
brought against him by others, with no reference to
Godwin in particular. For the most part he ignores
Godwin’s book on Population, as mere rhetoric and
scurrility.<a id='r840'></a><a href='#f840' class='c016'><sup>[840]</sup></a> Godwin, however, had given more than
two years of hard labour to the writing of it;<a id='r841'></a><a href='#f841' class='c016'><sup>[841]</sup></a> and his
biographer regards it as the last work of his best days.
He employed his son William and his friend Henry
Blanch Rosser to help him, in addition to Booth.
His whole mind was occupied with Booth’s calculations
and his own deductions from them. He himself
“could not pursue a calculation for an hour without
being sick to the lowest ebb.”<a id='r842'></a><a href='#f842' class='c016'><sup>[842]</sup></a> If Booth lagged
behind him he was miserable. He rose in early
morning to note down an idea and was ill for the rest
of the day after it. He is satisfied, however, with the
result of his labours. He thinks his chapter on the
Geometrical Ratio will delight his friends and astonish
his foes. In any case his comfort is that “truth”
will prevail, and, whether through him or another,
“the system of Malthus can never rise again, and
the world is delivered from this accursed apology in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>favour of vice and misery and hard-heartedness and
oppression,”<a id='r843'></a><a href='#f843' class='c016'><sup>[843]</sup></a> and the world will see that there is “no
need of any remedies,” for the numbers of mankind
never did and never can increase in the ways described
by Malthus.<a id='r844'></a><a href='#f844' class='c016'><sup>[844]</sup></a> A few of his younger friends<a id='r845'></a><a href='#f845' class='c016'><sup>[845]</sup></a> believed
him successful; and the book was mentioned in the
House of Commons as a conclusive refutation of
Malthus, especially in regard to the ratios.<a id='r846'></a><a href='#f846' class='c016'><sup>[846]</sup></a> But the
fact remains not only that poor Godwin made no
bread and butter by it,<a id='r847'></a><a href='#f847' class='c016'><sup>[847]</sup></a> but that he converted no one
whose opinion in such a matter was of any weight.
Mackintosh, though at peace again with his old friend,
when he writes to him in September 1821,<a id='r848'></a><a href='#f848' class='c016'><sup>[848]</sup></a> cannot
praise his work; even thinks its tone intolerant; and
will only say that he sees nothing in the Malthusian
doctrines inconsistent with perfectibility. He takes
pains at the same time to disclaim the authorship of
the notice in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> for July 1821,
which was lacking in the courtesy due to Godwin,
though it did not reproduce the scurrility of the
earliest review of him.<a id='r849'></a><a href='#f849' class='c016'><sup>[849]</sup></a> The inconclusiveness of the
book, even in the view of Malthus’ opponents, appears
from the stream of new refutations, which made no
pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even the question of the ratios was not settled.
Godwin had counted his discussion of them the most
important part of his book. It gives us his third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>substantial argument against Malthus. Godwin takes
up,<a id='r850'></a><a href='#f850' class='c016'><sup>[850]</sup></a> what seems to have been a common charge, that
the essayist had written a quarto volume to prove
that population increases in a geometrical and food
in an arithmetical ratio. The essayist had answered,
as long ago as 1806,<a id='r851'></a><a href='#f851' class='c016'><sup>[851]</sup></a> that the first proposition was
proved as soon as the facts about America were
authenticated, and the second was self-evident; his
book was meant less to prove the ratios than to trace
their effects. His authorities, as he told Godwin
afterwards,<a id='r852'></a><a href='#f852' class='c016'><sup>[852]</sup></a> were Dr. Price, Styles, Benjamin Franklin,
Euler, and Sir William Petty, supplemented, for
figures, by Short and Süssmilch and the censuses of
the United States and England, and, for principles,
by Adam Smith and Hume. We have already seen<a id='r853'></a><a href='#f853' class='c016'><sup>[853]</sup></a>
how far the simile of geometrical and arithmetical
ratios was meant to be pressed. Godwin thinks he
exposes it by arguing that the increase of population
can never be quite exactly geometrical<a id='r854'></a><a href='#f854' class='c016'><sup>[854]</sup></a> (which
Malthus would admit),—that America was an exception<a id='r855'></a><a href='#f855' class='c016'><sup>[855]</sup></a>
(in face of the maxim that the exception
tests the rule),—that, in order to suppose population
doubling itself in the United States, we must suppose
it, as regards births, doing the same in the Old
World (in other words, fact is the same as tendency),—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>the normal increase is not that of America
but that of Sweden,<a id='r856'></a><a href='#f856' class='c016'><sup>[856]</sup></a> in which case (Malthus would
answer) the normal increase must be one that takes
place in face of very severe restrictions. To the
charge of damaging the borrowed kettle the old Irishwoman
had three answers:—It was cracked when I
got it; it was whole when I returned it; I never had
it. So Godwin’s views of the American colonies
vacillated between three inconsistent propositions: the
great increase of the numbers is natural (or spontaneous),
but that of the food is greater still;<a id='r857'></a><a href='#f857' class='c016'><sup>[857]</sup></a> the great
increase is not natural, but due to immigration;<a id='r858'></a><a href='#f858' class='c016'><sup>[858]</sup></a>
there has been no great increase at all.<a id='r859'></a><a href='#f859' class='c016'><sup>[859]</sup></a> The reader
has three alternative arguments presented to him, and
it matters little whereby he is convinced, if only in
the end he is persuaded to believe with Godwin, that
population requires no checks at all,<a id='r860'></a><a href='#f860' class='c016'><sup>[860]</sup></a> and is a fitful
principle.<a id='r861'></a><a href='#f861' class='c016'><sup>[861]</sup></a> In history, says Godwin, it seems to
operate by fits and starts; and such irregular effects
cannot have a uniform cause. It might be replied
that in the same sense gravitation is fitful, for we
seem to break it by walking upstairs as well as
down, by using a siphon as well as a water-jug, or
by drying up a drop of ink with blotting-paper
instead of letting it sink down into the paper. Yet
in these cases the fitfulness is never imputed to the
absence of a cause, but to the presence of more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>causes than one. To believe, as Godwin seems to
do, in occult laws which vary with the circumstances
is to believe in no laws at all. The only constancy
would be the constant probability of miracles.<a id='r862'></a><a href='#f862' class='c016'><sup>[862]</sup></a> Freethinkers
had not as yet identified themselves with
the party of order in physics; and perhaps Godwin
was simply carrying out his dislike of law one step
farther. Having applied it to politics (1793) and to
style (1797), he now applied it to nature (1820).
He deliberately placed a whole army of facts out
of the range of science. It was fortunate for himself
that he appeared no more in the character of an
economist, but left Booth the task of replying to
the Edinburgh reviewer.<a id='r863'></a><a href='#f863' class='c016'><sup>[863]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>If economical criticism was weak with Godwin,
the political philosopher, it was still weaker with
Coleridge, the philosophizing poet. The main criticisms
of Coleridge<a id='r864'></a><a href='#f864' class='c016'><sup>[864]</sup></a> are contained in manuscript
marginal comments with pen and pencil written on
his copy of the second (quarto) edition of the
Essay (1803), now in the British Museum. When
Malthus writes (in Preface, p. vi) that if he had
confined himself to general views, his main principle
was so incontrovertible that he could have entrenched
himself in an impregnable fortress, Coleridge breaks
in: “If by the main principle the author means both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>the <em>Fact</em><a id='r865'></a><a href='#f865' class='c016'><sup>[865]</sup></a> (i. e. that population unrestrained should
infinitely outrun food) and the deduction from the
fact, <em>i. e.</em> that the human race is <em>therefore</em> not indefinitely
improvable, a pop-gun would batter down
the impregnable Fortress. If only the Fact be meant,
the assertion is quite nugatory, in the former case
vapouring, in the latter a vapour.” (And on p. vii:)
“Are we now to have a quarto to teach us that great
misery and great vice arise from poverty, and that
there must be poverty in its worst shape wherever
there are more mouths than loaves and more Heads
than Brains?”</p>

<p class='c007'>This may be taken as simply the argument of
Hazlitt, who “did not see what there was to be
proved;”—the principle of Malthus is a truism.
Even when commenting on the statement of the
Ratios (on p. 8), after some denunciation of the
“verbiage and senseless repetition” of the essay,
Coleridge goes on to agree with it. He would restate
the whole so as to substitute “a proportion which
no one in his senses would consider as other than
axiomatic, viz.: Suppose that the human race amount
to a thousand millions. Divide the square acres of
food-producing surface by 500,000,000, that is to say,
so much to each married couple. Estimate this
quotum as high as you like, and, if you will, even at
a thousand or even at ten thousand acres to each
family. Suppose population without check, and take
the average increase from two families at five (which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>irrationally small, supposing the human race healthy,
and each man married at twenty-one to a woman of
eighteen), and in twelve generations the increase
would be 48,828,125. Now as to any conceivable
increase in the production or improvement in the
productiveness of the thousand or ten thousand acres,
it is ridiculous even to think of production at all,
inasmuch as it is demonstrable that either already in
this twelfth generation, or <em>certainly</em> in a few generations
more (I leave the exact statement to schoolboys,
not having Cocker’s Arithmetic by me, and having
forgotten the number of square feet in an acre), the
quotum of land would not furnish standing room
to the descendants of the first agrarian proprietors.
Best do the sum at once. Find out the number of
square acres on the globe (of land), and divide the
number by 500,000. I have myself been uselessly
prolix, and in grappling with the man have caught his
itch of verbiage.” He goes on to say that if every
man were to marry and have a family, and each of his
children were to do the same, their posterity would
soon want standing room, and, if <em>all</em> checks were
removed, this would of course happen much faster.
“Any schoolboy who has learned arithmetic as far as
compound interest may astonish his younger sister
both by the fact and by the exact number of years
in which it would take place. On the other hand, let
the productiveness of the earth be increased beyond
the hopes of the most visionary agriculturist, still the
productions take up room. If the present crop of
turnips occupy one-fifth of the space of the turnip
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>field, the increase can never be more than quintupled,
and, if you suppose two planted for one, the increase
still cannot exceed ten; so that, supposing a little
island of a single acre, and its productions occupying
one-fifth of its absolute space, and sufficient to maintain
two men and two women, four generations would
outrun its <em>possible</em> power of furnishing them with
food; and we may boldly affirm that a truth so self-evident
as this was never overlooked or even by
implication contradicted. What proof has Mr.
Malthus brought? What proof can he bring that
any writer or theorist has overlooked this fact, which
would not apply (with reverence be it spoken) to the
Almighty Himself when He pronounced the awful
command, ‘Increase and multiply’?”</p>

<p class='c007'>From some of the phrases dropped in the course
of these comments, we should infer they were the
preparation for a formal review of the book by
Coleridge himself. It is therefore extremely puzzling
to find the whole comments printed almost word
for word and letter for letter in a review<a id='r866'></a><a href='#f866' class='c016'><sup>[866]</sup></a> hitherto
considered by every one (Southey included) to
be Southey’s. This applies to the subsequent MS.
notes, which are happily briefer. Coleridge finds
fault with Malthus (p. 11) for using the words
virtue and vice without defining them, apparently
overlooking the footnote under his very eyes (p.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>11 n.) which says, “The general consequence of
vice is misery, and this consequence is the precise
reason why an action is termed vicious.”<a id='r867'></a><a href='#f867' class='c016'><sup>[867]</sup></a> Coleridge
says, in relation to the list of irregularities given in
the last paragraph but one of the page (11): “That
these and all these are vices in the present state
of society, who doubt? So was Celibacy in the
patriarchal ages. Vice and Virtue subsist in the
agreement of the habits of a man with his reason
and conscience, and these can have but one moral
guide, Utility, or the Virtue<a id='r868'></a><a href='#f868' class='c016'><sup>[868]</sup></a> and Happiness of
Rational beings. We mention this not under the
miserable notion that any state of society will render
those actions capable of being performed with conscience
and virtue, but to expose the utter unguardedness
of this speculation.” Then after some remarks
on New Malthusians (as they would be now called)
he goes on: “All that follows to the three hundred
and fifty-fifth page<a id='r869'></a><a href='#f869' class='c016'><sup>[869]</sup></a> may be an entertaining farrago
of quotations from books of travels, &amp;c., but surely
very impertinent in a philosophical work. Bless me,
three hundred and forty pages—for what purpose!
A philosophical work can have no legitimate purpose
but proof and illustration, and three hundred and
fifty pages to prove an axiom! to illustrate a self-evident
truth! It is neither more nor less than bookmaking!”
He thinks, however, that what Malthus
wrote of Condorcet applies to himself;—though his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>paradox is very absurd, it must be refuted, or he
will think the toleration of his contemporaries due
to their mental inferiority and his own sublimity
of intellect.<a id='r870'></a><a href='#f870' class='c016'><sup>[870]</sup></a> The remaining marginal notes are
chiefly of an interjectional character,<a id='r871'></a><a href='#f871' class='c016'><sup>[871]</sup></a> many of them
not very refined. Malthus himself never falls into
coarseness; but his opponents seldom avoid it, and
Coleridge (or Southey) is no exception to the rule.<a id='r872'></a><a href='#f872' class='c016'><sup>[872]</sup></a>
Except for the interest attaching even to the foolish
words of a great man, it would not have been worth
while to revive his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">obiter scripta</span></i> on a matter beyond
his ken.</p>

<p class='c007'>A few words are necessary in regard to Grahame
and Weyland, who form the chief subject of the long
second appendix of later editions of the essay.
Grahame’s charges were such as owed all their force
to the general ignorance of the actual writings of
Malthus himself.<a id='r873'></a><a href='#f873' class='c016'><sup>[873]</sup></a> Mr. Malthus regards famine as
nature’s benevolent remedy for want of food; Mr.
Malthus believes that nature teaches men to invent
(p. 100) diseases in order to prevent over-population;
Mr. Malthus, regarding vice and misery generally
as benevolent remedies for over-population, thinks
that they are rather to be encouraged than otherwise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>(p. 100). Malthus, for his part, deploring the fact
that this last charge has been current “in various
quarters for fourteen years” (or since his quarto
essay of 1803), thinks he may well pass it by.
“Vice and Misery, and these alone, are the evils
which it has been my great object to contend against.
I have expressly proposed moral restraint as their
rational and proper remedy,” a sufficient proof that
he regarded them as the disease.<a id='r874'></a><a href='#f874' class='c016'><sup>[874]</sup></a> Grahame himself
does not deny the tendency to increase beyond food
(p. 102), but thinks emigration a sufficient remedy
(p. 104).</p>

<p class='c007'>Empson,<a id='r875'></a><a href='#f875' class='c016'><sup>[875]</sup></a> playfully classifying the opponents of
Malthus, says there are some who will not comprehend
“out of sheer stupidity, like Mr. Grahame,”
or out of sentimental horror, like Southey,<a id='r876'></a><a href='#f876' class='c016'><sup>[876]</sup></a> Coleridge,
and Bishop Huntingford;<a id='r877'></a><a href='#f877' class='c016'><sup>[877]</sup></a> or because, like Sadler<a id='r878'></a><a href='#f878' class='c016'><sup>[878]</sup></a>
and Godwin, who followed Price and Muret,<a id='r879'></a><a href='#f879' class='c016'><sup>[879]</sup></a> they
imagine the law of population to vary with the circumstances;
or else because they invent laws of their
own, like Anderson, Owen, and Poulett Scrope;<a id='r880'></a><a href='#f880' class='c016'><sup>[880]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>or because, like Weyland,<a id='r881'></a><a href='#f881' class='c016'><sup>[881]</sup></a> they deny the premises
of Malthus as well as the conclusion. Weyland,
like Grahame, has the honour of a special refutation
from Malthus. He allows that Malthus in
his essay has raised his subject from the level of
desultory academical discussion to that of scientific
inquiry, and his book is the point from which every
later investigation must start. He allows that his
order is lucid and his reasoning fair, and that he
enables an opponent at once to discuss the question
on its merits. Granting his premises, says Weyland,
we cannot deny his conclusion; but that premise
of his is false which assumes that the highest known
rate of increase in a particular state of society is the
natural or spontaneous rate in all;<a id='r882'></a><a href='#f882' class='c016'><sup>[882]</sup></a> we cannot take
the height of Chang or of the Hale Child as the
natural standard of the height of all. To this
Malthus answers, that, if we had observed in any
country that all the people who were short carried
weights upon their heads, and the people who were
tall did not, we should infer that the weights had
something to do with the height,—and so, when we
find that the increase of a people is fast or slow in
proportion as the pressure of certain checks on increase
is heavy or light, we cannot but believe that
the rate would be at its fastest if there were no
checks at all. To say with Weyland, in the terms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>of his first cardinal proposition,<a id='r883'></a><a href='#f883' class='c016'><sup>[883]</sup></a> that “population has
a natural tendency to keep within the powers of the
soil to afford it subsistence in every gradation through
which society passes,” is to say “that every man
has a natural tendency to remain in prison who is
necessarily confined to it by four strong walls.” One
might as well infer that the pine of the crowded
Norwegian forest has no tendency to have lateral
branches, because as a matter of fact there is no room
for it to have any.<a id='r884'></a><a href='#f884' class='c016'><sup>[884]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Weyland thinks that, without any moral restraint,
population will keep within limits of the food, in
proportion as it reaches a high state of morality,
religion, and political liberty.<a id='r885'></a><a href='#f885' class='c016'><sup>[885]</sup></a> Malthus, on the contrary,
would say that, without moral restraint, even
morality, religion, and political liberty will not save
a people from wretchedness;<a id='r886'></a><a href='#f886' class='c016'><sup>[886]</sup></a> and, for his part, the
design always uppermost in his mind when writing
has been “to improve the condition and increase the
happiness of the lower classes of society.”<a id='r887'></a><a href='#f887' class='c016'><sup>[887]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One argument of Weyland’s<a id='r888'></a><a href='#f888' class='c016'><sup>[888]</sup></a> has some weight in
it. With a rich soil, high farming, and abundant
food, the bulk of the people of a country might by
the natural division of labour be employed in manufacture,
and their unhealthy manner of life in towns
might so check population that it might be far from
keeping up to the level of the food. Malthus replies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>that this case is rare, for our town populations have
increased rapidly,—but, such as it is, he has allowed
for it in the second clause of his second proposition:
“Population invariably increases where the means
of subsistence increase, <em>unless prevented by some very
powerful and obvious checks</em>.”<a id='r889'></a><a href='#f889' class='c016'><sup>[889]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There are two other critics to whom Malthus
replies in some detail, one the visionary Owen, who
is embraced in Empson’s classification, the other the
practical man Arthur Young, who cannot so easily
be classified. “I mean,” says the latter, “to deal
in facts alone, happy when I can discover them pure
and unalloyed with prejudice.”<a id='r890'></a><a href='#f890' class='c016'><sup>[890]</sup></a> As this was his
practice as well as his profession, it may easily be
believed that in his voluminous records of fifty years’
travelling and experimenting<a id='r891'></a><a href='#f891' class='c016'><sup>[891]</sup></a> he has spun rope enough
to hang himself. It ought to be added that, like
Godwin, he claims the privilege of being inconsistent.
Nothing could be more clear than his recognition in
his <cite>Travels in France</cite> of the evils of over-population.<a id='r892'></a><a href='#f892' class='c016'><sup>[892]</sup></a>
Yet in 1800, in his <cite>Question of Scarcity plainly stated
and Remedies considered</cite>, he recommends as his remedy
that each country labourer who has three children be
provided with a cow and half an acre of potato ground.<a id='r893'></a><a href='#f893' class='c016'><sup>[893]</sup></a>
In other words, he would reduce the English standard
of living to the common Irish one, milk and potatoes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>Malthus replies by giving reasons why people should
“live dear,” and by reminding Arthur Young of his
own comments on the proceedings of the National
Assembly. Recognizing their duty to grant relief,
but wishing to avoid an English Poor Law, the
National Assembly set aside fifty millions of francs
a year for support of the poor. If it had been
really a duty, wrote Arthur Young (in his <cite>Travels</cite>),
necessity might have occasioned them to extend the
relief to one hundred, two hundred, or three hundred
millions, and so on, “in the same miserable progression
that has taken place in England.”<a id='r894'></a><a href='#f894' class='c016'><sup>[894]</sup></a> Malthus hardly
needed to go back to the <cite>Travels</cite>, as Young himself
confessed in his later writings that his plan did
not apply to large cities, and though he still held
by the claim of right, he confessed that his faith
must be without works; in other words, he claimed
the right to be inconsistent. But he continued to
question Malthus’ axiom that what cannot be ought
not to be; and he thinks that, if a man marries
without the means to keep a family, he may justly
blame society for not providing him with the means.
He argues, too, that Malthus for the success of his
scheme assumes perfect chastity in the unmarried.
Malthus really assumed only that the evils, which
on an average in a civilized country attend the
prudential check, are less than the evils of premature
mortality and other miseries entailed by the opposite
course; he declares himself not against but in favour
of schemes that improve the condition of the poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>even on a limited scale; and he only asks that every
such scheme be tested not by its first success, for
hardly any scheme of the kind is unsuccessful at first,
but by its effect on a new generation.<a id='r895'></a><a href='#f895' class='c016'><sup>[895]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This test might be applied to schemes like Owen’s
and later ones on the same model. Malthus perhaps
deals too peremptorily with them. Speaking of
Owen’s system of the community of labour and goods,
and of Spence’s <cite>Plan for Parochial Partnerships in
the Land</cite><a id='r896'></a><a href='#f896' class='c016'><sup>[896]</sup></a> (“the only remedy for the distresses and
oppressions of the people,” the land to be “the
people’s farm”), he answers that there are two
“decisive arguments against systems of equality”:
first, the inability of a state of equality to furnish
adequate motives for exertion, the goad of necessity
being absent,—and, second, the tendency of population
to increase faster than subsistence. In reply it must
be said that there might be socialism without communism;
there might even be communism without an
absolute equality, such as would put idle and industrious
on the same footing; there might be an
approximation of the social extremes, bringing poor
and rich nearer, and giving the former not weaker
but stronger motives to exertion; finally, it is not at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>all inconceivable that at least one-half of this result
might come, as Godwin wished, by the act of the
rich themselves, which means also as Malthus wished,
for it would come from a strong sense of personal
obligation. It cannot be denied that Malthus, in
using the argument in question, seems to forget his
own admission, that the goad of necessity does not
act with effect either on the lowest or on the highest
classes.<a id='r897'></a><a href='#f897' class='c016'><sup>[897]</sup></a> Moreover, he allows, there have been cases,
<em>e. g.</em> among the Moravian communities, where industry
and community of goods have existed side by side.
“It may be said that, allowing the stimulus of inequality
of conditions to have been necessary in order
to raise man from the indolence and apathy of the
savage to the activity and intelligence of civilized
life, it does not follow that the continuance of the
same stimulus should be necessary when this activity
and energy of mind has been once gained.”<a id='r898'></a><a href='#f898' class='c016'><sup>[898]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The second of his arguments against Owen is of
course his more cogent and characteristic one. As
we have seen, it is not deprived of its point by
the inclusion of moral restraint among the checks
to population. It was argued against him that
his own ideal of a society where moral restraint
universally prevailed would involve precisely what
is necessary to make such systems as Godwin’s
and Owen’s permanently possible.<a id='r899'></a><a href='#f899' class='c016'><sup>[899]</sup></a> There is an air
of conclusiveness in the remark that, in proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>as moral restraint prevails in the world, Malthus
approximates to Godwin. But Malthus believes that
equality and community would destroy the motive
for moral restraint. The passions would still be
present, and no man would be in a position where
there seemed any need to restrain them; the restraint
would be the interest of the whole society, but not
of the individual himself, for the effects were to be
borne not by himself, but by the whole society. No
doubt the good of the whole society ought to be a
sufficient reason; but it would be so in a very few
men now; and, unless it were in all men then, the
result would be an expansion of population, with the
results Malthus described. Owen is aware of this,
and suggests artificial checks, allowing men to gratify
desire without the usual consequences, and dispensing
with any effort of will. Malthus, on the other hand,
would throw all the responsibility and burden on the
individual, which he thinks it impossible to do without
allowing the individual his private property.<a id='r900'></a><a href='#f900' class='c016'><sup>[900]</sup></a> No
further justification of things as they are is to be
found in Malthus; and, so far from being reactionary,
his principles (with all their qualifications) were probably
the most advanced individualism that was ever
preached in these days. They are adopted in full
view of the facts that have been again vividly brought
before the public mind in our day by writers who are
to our generation what Godwin, Spence, and Owen
were to theirs.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>Malthus seems to believe, with Dugald Stewart,
that Utopian schemes are like the tunes of a barrel-organ,
recurring at melancholy intervals from age to
age with damnable iteration.<a id='r901'></a><a href='#f901' class='c016'><sup>[901]</sup></a> But, unless society
itself has moved in a circle, the Utopias will resemble
each other no more and no less than do the states of
society which they would replace. Our own socialists,
therefore, can hardly be dismissed by the stroke of
the pen, that classifies them with people so curiously
unlike them and each other as Plato, Ball, More, the
Fifth Monarchy men, the Levellers, Godwin and
Spence and Owen. Malthus does not, in fact, so
dismiss them. Besides bringing forward his own argument,
he examines Owen’s attempt to deal with it.<a id='r902'></a><a href='#f902' class='c016'><sup>[902]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Since Malthus, every complete reform has needed
to face in some way or other the question which he
treated; but he left little for others to do. Of the
two most prominent schemes of our own day for the
reconstruction of society, one, that of Mr. Henry
George, involves an unconscious recourse to the old
weapons of Godwin, Sadler, and other opponents of
Malthus; <cite>Progress and Poverty</cite> does not contain any
argument not to be found in these writers. The
conjecture about a “fixed quantity of human life on
the earth” (ed. 1881, p. 97) is hardly an argument.
It may be compared with what is stated by St. G.
Mivart<a id='r903'></a><a href='#f903' class='c016'><sup>[903]</sup></a> to be the basis of Darwinism. “Every
individual has to endure a very severe struggle for
existence owing to the tendency to geometrical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>increase of all kinds of animals and plants, while
the total animal and vegetable population (man and
his agency excepted) remains almost stationary.” Mr.
Mivart’s reason for excepting man seems to be Mr.
George’s reason for including him. The latter’s more
direct arguments against Malthus are as follows:—first,
the difficulty is in the future (p. 85);—second,
Malthus shifts the responsibility from man to the
Creator (p. 87);—third, Malthus justifies the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">status
quo</span></i> and parries the demand for reform (p. 88);—fourth,
Malthus ascribes excessive increase of numbers
to a general tendency of human nature, while it is
really due to the badness of our institutions in old
countries, as in India and Ireland (pp. 101–114),
or the very thinness of population in new (p. 92);—fifth,
Malthus does not distinguish between tendency
to increase and actual increase, and is therefore
refuted by the fact that the world is not yet
peopled (p. 94). In the sixth place, we are told, if
there had been such a law as the Malthusian, it would
have been sooner and more widely recognized (p. 98);—that
families often become extinct (p. 99), and it is
more certain that we have ancestors than that we shall
have descendants;<a id='r904'></a><a href='#f904' class='c016'><sup>[904]</sup></a>—that better industry would keep
a larger population (p. 107);—Malthus says that vice
and misery are necessary (p. 109);—Malthus does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>see that vegetables and animals increase faster than
population (p. 115),—or that the increase of man involves
the increase of his food (p. 116), for a division
of labour makes man produce more than he consumes
(p. 126), and so the most populous countries are
always the most wealthy (p. 128);—Malthus forgets
that the world is wide (p. 119),—and that the
tendency to increase is checked by development of
intellect,<a id='r905'></a><a href='#f905' class='c016'><sup>[905]</sup></a>—and by the elevation of the standard
of comfort (pp. 121, 123);—he forgets that “the
power of population to produce the necessaries of
life is not to be measured by the necessaries of life”
it actually produces, but by its powers to produce
wealth in all forms (p. 127);—Malthus will not see
that twenty men where nature is niggardly (<em>e. g.</em> on
a bare rock?) will produce more than twenty times
what one man will where nature is bountiful (p.
134);—and the Malthusian theory “attributes want
to the decrease of productive power” (p. 134);—finally
Malthus does not know “the real law of
population,” which is that “the tendency to increase,
instead of being always uniform, is strong where a
greater population would give increased comfort, and
where the perpetuity of the race is threatened by the
mortality induced by adverse conditions, but weakens
just as the higher development of the individual
becomes possible, and the perpetuity of the race is
assured” (p. 123). What is right in this view of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>the real law of population is common to Mr. George
with Mr. Herbert Spencer;<a id='r906'></a><a href='#f906' class='c016'><sup>[906]</sup></a> what is wrong is common
to him with Godwin.<a id='r907'></a><a href='#f907' class='c016'><sup>[907]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The view of Karl Marx,<a id='r908'></a><a href='#f908' class='c016'><sup>[908]</sup></a> the prophet of the International
and of modern economic Socialism, is built
on much more solid foundations. It is a corollary of
his view of capital. The general law of the accumulation
of capital, in these days of large manufactories
and machinery, involves not only a progressive addition
to the quantity of capital, which is all that Adam
Smith contemplated, but a qualitative change in the
proportion between fixed capital, such as machinery,
and the circulating which is paid in wages. To use
the author’s words, the progress of accumulation
brings with it a relative decrease of the variable
component of capital and a relative increase of its
constant component. New machinery is constantly
supplanting labour without any real compensation in
increased demand, either at once or in the long
run. The constant element increases at the cost of
the variable; and this can only result in the progressive
production of a population which, in relation
to capital, is a surplus or superfluity, an over-population;—the
cause which increases the net
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>revenue of the country at the same time renders the
population redundant and deteriorates the condition
of the labourer.<a id='r909'></a><a href='#f909' class='c016'><sup>[909]</sup></a> So far from deploring the existence
of this redundant class, the capitalists depend on it,<a id='r910'></a><a href='#f910' class='c016'><sup>[910]</sup></a>
as the reserve of their army. They trust to its
cheap labour to save them from the depression
which in our days (though never before) appears
with unfailing regularity after brisk trade and a crisis.
If the hands were not always there for them to
employ, they would not at once be able to seize the
happy moment of a reviving demand for their goods.
“Malthus with his narrow views understands the
surplus population to be superfluous absolutely in
itself, and not merely in relation to capital; but
even he recognizes that over-population is a necessity
of modern industry.”<a id='r911'></a><a href='#f911' class='c016'><sup>[911]</sup></a> In proof of these statements
he quotes the words of Malthus (<cite>Pol. Econ.</cite>, ed. 1836,
pp. 215,<a id='r912'></a><a href='#f912' class='c016'><sup>[912]</sup></a> 319, 320):—“Prudential habits with regard
to marriage carried to a considerable extent among
the labouring classes, of a country mainly depending
upon manufactures and commerce, might injure it.”...
“From the nature of a population, an increase
of labourers cannot be brought into [the] market,
in consequence of a particular demand, till after
the lapse of sixteen or eighteen years; and the
conversion of revenue into capital, by saving, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>take place much more rapidly; a country is always
liable to an increase in the quantity of the funds for
the maintenance of labour faster than the increase
of population.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To these charges the answer is, first, that Malthus
always recognized that over-population was relative,
relative to the actual food;<a id='r913'></a><a href='#f913' class='c016'><sup>[913]</sup></a> second, that he did <em>not</em>
recognize the over-population as necessary; it took
place as a matter of fact, but he believed that, if
working men did as he wished them, it would disappear;<a id='r914'></a><a href='#f914' class='c016'><sup>[914]</sup></a>—and
in the third place, the first sentence
quoted by Marx, from the <cite>Political Economy</cite> is
explained by the second, which he does not quote:
“In a country of fertile land such habits would be
the greatest of all conceivable blessings.” Malthus
is comparing Commercial with Agricultural countries,
not pronouncing on the general question of wages;
and other passages in his writings<a id='r915'></a><a href='#f915' class='c016'><sup>[915]</sup></a> show that he
regarded the high wages, resulting from prudential
habits, as a public gain, more than compensating
the capitalists’ loss of profits. Even Marx himself
grudgingly allows that Malthus was more humane
than Ricardo in regard to the hours of labour desirable
for the workmen.<a id='r916'></a><a href='#f916' class='c016'><sup>[916]</sup></a> In the fourth place, the
latter half of the quotation (beginning with the
words, “From the nature of a population”) first
states an obvious fact which a child could have
pointed out, and then a disputable proposition which
predicts not an over-population but the reverse of it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Marx is seeking to demonstrate the hopelessness
of the labourer’s position; and he is too acute not
to know that his demonstration would be seriously
weakened if he admitted the truth of the Malthusian
doctrine and the bare possibility of the adoption of
prudential habits by the labourers. This is the real
reason of his bitter attacks on the Essay. He says of
it:<a id='r917'></a><a href='#f917' class='c016'><sup>[917]</sup></a> “When I say Eden’s work on the Poor was the
only important writing by a disciple of Adam Smith
in the eighteenth century, I may be reminded of the
essay of Malthus. But this book in its first form
(and the later editions did nothing but add and adapt
borrowed materials) is nothing but a plagiarism from
Sir James Steuart, Townsend, Franklin, Wallace, full
of schoolboy superficiality and clerical declamation,
and not containing a single original sentence. By
the way, although Malthus was a clergyman of the
Church of England, he had taken the monastic
oath of celibacy[!], for this is one of the conditions
of a fellowship at the Protestant University of
Cambridge. ‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Socios collegiorum maritos esse non
permittimus, sed statim postquam quis uxorem
duxerit, socius collegii desinat esse</span>’ (<cite>Reports of
Cambridge University Commission</cite>, p. 172). By this
circumstance Malthus is favourably distinguished
from the other Protestant clergy, who have cast off
the Catholic rule of celibacy....<a id='r918'></a><a href='#f918' class='c016'><sup>[918]</sup></a> With exception of
Ortes<a id='r919'></a><a href='#f919' class='c016'><sup>[919]</sup></a> the Venetian monk, an original and clever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>writer, most of the writers on Population are Protestant
clergymen,” a contrast, he goes on, to the
days when political economists were all philosophers.
Marx adopts<a id='r920'></a><a href='#f920' class='c016'><sup>[920]</sup></a> the common view that Malthus being
a clergyman was the bond-slave of Toryism and
the ruling classes, and therefore ready to adopt
a principle that attributed over-population to the
eternal laws of nature rather than to the historical
laws (also natural) of the capitalists’ production. Marx
does not see that the “eternal laws” in question do
not lead to over-population except when the precepts
of Malthus are neglected; and never shows how,
apart from these precepts, over-population will be
prevented in the renovated society itself, which has
nationalized not only the land but all the instruments
of production. Would the habits of men be so
changed by this stroke of nationalization that the
want of ordinary commercial motives would not be
felt?<a id='r921'></a><a href='#f921' class='c016'><sup>[921]</sup></a> Would not the millennium of the Socialist, like
that of the Christian, postulate a religious conversion
on the largest scale for its first introduction,
to say nothing of its continuance? Productive Co-operation,
depending on the spontaneous action of
the labourers for its creation, and on their intelligence
and prudence for its success, would nationalize capital
more surely; and it would not make the impossible
postulate of Socialism, that a passionless unselfishness,
which not one in a hundred thousand in our
day exhibits at any time, shall at once become the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>invariable daily rule of all without exception. But
Co-operation, if it neglects Malthus, will find its work
no sooner done than undone.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be thought that there are causes at work
which will remove over-population among the working
classes even under the present system of separated
capital and labour. It is a doctrine of the “finer
wits,” founded on striking biological analogies, that
the general development of intellect in the race will
weaken the passion for marriage and supersede the
necessity for any checks on it;<a id='r922'></a><a href='#f922' class='c016'><sup>[922]</sup></a>—the exercise of the
energies of concentration or “individuation” developes
these energies at the expense of those of diffusion or
“genesis;”—the individual is made strong in himself,
at the expense of his power of creating new individuals.
Quite apart from the disagreeable fact that
this principle would lessen the pressure most in those
classes where lessening is at present least needed,
and least where it is most needed, Malthus would
probably have pointed out, first, that unless the
appetite is absolutely killed, no physiological check
can supersede some control of the will over the
passion,—and, second, that intellectual development
will more certainly check population by making men
alive to their responsibilities and strengthening their
power of restraint than by weakening the passion to
be restrained. The expounder of the theory is of all
people the least likely to teach men that they may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>become civilized by the progress of their race without
the trouble of civilizing themselves individually. But
his theory admits the misapplication; and, if it be
said by the misappliers that we ought to tell the
truth without fear of consequences, we must answer
that in this case the consequences are part of the
truth. On the other hand, to theorists like W. R.
Greg, who suggest unknown physiological laws that
may act as a spontaneous check, Malthus would have
replied as to Condorcet:<a id='r923'></a><a href='#f923' class='c016'><sup>[923]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This brief survey of typical critics and commentators
may be completed by a classification of the
former, which, among other advantages, will give a
bird’s-eye view of the chief points in discussion.
Empson classified the opponents of Malthus by their
motives,<a id='r924'></a><a href='#f924' class='c016'><sup>[924]</sup></a> a proceeding hardly fair either to them
or to the essay itself. It is not fair to them, for as
a rule the critics appeal to argument, and must be
judged by what they adduce, not by their good or
ill will, wisdom or folly, in adducing it; and not fair
to the essay, because few books have owed so much
to their reviewers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The positions of the critics may be classified as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>I. Some say the doctrine of the essay is a
truism.<a id='r925'></a><a href='#f925' class='c016'><sup>[925]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>II. Others admit that it is unanswerable, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>retain a philosophical faith in the future discovery
of some contrary principle.<a id='r926'></a><a href='#f926' class='c016'><sup>[926]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>III. Others find fault with the details of the
doctrine, either (<em>a</em>) in regard to the ratios of increase,
asserting that no tendency to a geometrical increase
of population has been proved, but something much
less rapid, even (a few say) a decreasing ratio,<a id='r927'></a><a href='#f927' class='c016'><sup>[927]</sup></a>—and
that no mere arithmetical increase of food has been
proved, but something much more rapid,<a id='r928'></a><a href='#f928' class='c016'><sup>[928]</sup></a>—or (<em>b</em>) in
regard to the checks on population, asserting that no
checks are necessary,<a id='r929'></a><a href='#f929' class='c016'><sup>[929]</sup></a>—that vice and misery sometimes
add to population instead of checking it,<a id='r930'></a><a href='#f930' class='c016'><sup>[930]</sup></a>—that
to include moral restraint is to stultify the
original doctrine,<a id='r931'></a><a href='#f931' class='c016'><sup>[931]</sup></a>—that moral restraint sometimes
involves as great evil as excessive numbers, both from
the personal practice of it and from the preaching
of it to others,<a id='r932'></a><a href='#f932' class='c016'><sup>[932]</sup></a>—that important checks have been
omitted, the chief being misgovernment,<a id='r933'></a><a href='#f933' class='c016'><sup>[933]</sup></a> bad laws,<a id='r934'></a><a href='#f934' class='c016'><sup>[934]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>high feeding,<a id='r935'></a><a href='#f935' class='c016'><sup>[935]</sup></a> intellectual development,<a id='r936'></a><a href='#f936' class='c016'><sup>[936]</sup></a> and those
of Owen.<a id='r937'></a><a href='#f937' class='c016'><sup>[937]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is, besides, an <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i> criticism, which is
either (I.) ecclesiastical,<a id='r938'></a><a href='#f938' class='c016'><sup>[938]</sup></a> alleging that Malthus contradicts
the Bible or some other authority,—(II.)
theological,<a id='r939'></a><a href='#f939' class='c016'><sup>[939]</sup></a> that he denies Providence,—or (III.)
doctrinaire,<a id='r940'></a><a href='#f940' class='c016'><sup>[940]</sup></a> that he denies natural rights and the
pre-established harmony of moral and economical
laws, and the instinct of equality,—or (IV.) ethical
and popular,<a id='r941'></a><a href='#f941' class='c016'><sup>[941]</sup></a> that he runs counter to the moral
sense and the natural benevolence of men and cosmopolitan
morality. These arguments have been
already considered. The fourth of them has, in its
last branch, an appearance of truth, because Malthus
has certainly pled less for the cosmopolitan than for
the domestic and civic virtues. He wishes to lay the
foundations solidly and leave the building to others.
Cosmopolitan morality can rarely be the foundation.
In the Empire, Christianity may have raised
the people, and Stoicism the philosophers, to the
wider morality without the training of the narrower,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>so that the converts were made better members of
their own small communities by becoming members
of the commonwealth of the saints and citizens of
the great world. But it seems to Malthus that, in
the world of to-day, the many conditions of a steady
moral progress are best secured if the domestic and
civic virtues precede the cosmopolitan. We must
not legislate for a world of heroes, but for men as
we know them to be; and a comfortable domestic life
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">βίος τέλειος</span>) must be the common highway to goodness
in a society of ordinary men. If poverty were
no evil, churlishness would be no vice. But extreme
poverty<a id='r942'></a><a href='#f942' class='c016'><sup>[942]</sup></a> is a real hindrance to goodness. In the
apparent exceptions, as in the voluntary poverty of
St. Francis, the greatest evil is absent, for there is no
struggle for bare life. To abolish that struggle, and
help men to comfort, is in some degree to help men
to goodness; and it was the end for which Malthus
laboured. The most sure and solid way of reaching
it lay, as he thought, in impressing every man with
a strong sense of his responsibility for his acts and of
his power over his own destiny. To reform a nation,
we must reform the members of it, who, if they are
good at first in spite of their institutions, will at last
conform their institutions to the model of their own
goodness. To hold men the creatures of society,
and make society responsible for their character, was,
he thought, to mistake the order of nature. Society
can feel its responsibility only in its individual
members; and no member of it can free his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>soul by the purity of a collective or representative
conscience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The doctrine of Malthus is, therefore, a strong
appeal to personal responsibility. He would make
men strong in will, to subdue their animal wants to
their notion of personal good and personal goodness,
which, he believed, could never fail to develope into
the common good and goodness of all. Believers in
the omnipotence of outward circumstances and the
powerlessness of the human will, to alter them or the
human character, may put Malthus beyond the pale
of sympathy. But all can enter into the mind of
Malthus and understand his work, who know the
hardness of the struggle between the flesh and the
spirit, and yet believe in the power of ideas to change
the lives of men, and have faith not only in the
rigour of natural laws, but in man’s power to conquer
nature by obeying her.</p>

<p class='c006'>The few facts that are known of the life of Malthus
bring us nearer to him than we can come in his
writings, and show us how well, on the whole, his
antecedents and surroundings fitted him for his
work. Our chief authorities are Bishop Otter’s biographical
preface to the second edition of our author’s
<cite>Political Economy</cite>, which was posthumously published
in 1836, and Professor Empson’s notice of the book
in the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> for January 1837.<a id='r943'></a><a href='#f943' class='c016'><sup>[943]</sup></a> Otter
was the college companion and life-long friend of
Malthus; Empson was his colleague at Haileybury.
The information they give us, though meagre, is
trustworthy; and happily it can be supplemented
by hints from other quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>His father, Daniel Malthus, was born in 1730, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>went to Queen’s College, Oxford, in 1747,<a id='r944'></a><a href='#f944' class='c016'><sup>[944]</sup></a> the year
when Adam Smith went home from Balliol to
Scotland. He left without a degree, not because of
the Articles, for he subscribed them at matriculation,<a id='r945'></a><a href='#f945' class='c016'><sup>[945]</sup></a>
or from Dr. Johnson’s reason of poverty, for he was
a gentleman commoner, but probably from a contempt
for the distinction itself.<a id='r946'></a><a href='#f946' class='c016'><sup>[946]</sup></a> His mind was active
and open, and he seems to have formed literary
friendships that stood his son in good stead afterwards.
He liked to stay up in Oxford in vacation,
working hard at his own studies in his own ways,
and seeing none but chosen friends. He wrote to his
son in later years, “I used to think Oxford none the
less pleasant and certainly not the less useful for
being disburdened of some of its society; I imagine
you will say the same of Cambridge.”<a id='r947'></a><a href='#f947' class='c016'><sup>[947]</sup></a> On leaving
the university he married and went to live in Surrey
at a quiet country house on the way from Dorking
to Guildford, still known by its old name of the
Rookery. Of his eldest son, who took his grandfather’s
name of Sydenham,<a id='r948'></a><a href='#f948' class='c016'><sup>[948]</sup></a> we know little except that
in due time he married, and had two sons, Sydenham
and Charles, and a daughter Mary. Mary died single
in 1881 in her eighty-second year, Charles in 1821
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>in his fifteenth, their father in 1821 in his sixty-eighth.
Sydenham, our author’s nephew, who died
in 1869, was proprietor of Dalton Hill, Albury, where
members of his family were, till recently, still living;
his son, Lieut.-Col. Sydenham Malthus, C.B., of the
94th Regiment, served with distinction in the Zulu
war a few years ago.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daniel’s second son, Thomas Robert, familiarly
known as Robert, was born at the Rookery on 14th
February, 1766, the year when Rousseau came to
England. His mother seems to have died before
her husband; she is not mentioned in our meagre
biographies.<a id='r949'></a><a href='#f949' class='c016'><sup>[949]</sup></a> His father, full of the teaching of the
Émile, and by no means prejudiced by his Oxford
experience in favour of the ordinary conventional
training of the English youth, seems to have sent
his sons to no public school of any kind, and in
all probability brought them up at home under his
own eye for the first eight or nine years of their
life. We may think of Robert, therefore, as passing
his childhood without privation, if without luxury,
in the home of an English country gentleman of
moderate fortune, who was devoted to books and
botany, fireside and hillside philosophizing,<a id='r950'></a><a href='#f950' class='c016'><sup>[950]</sup></a> and the
improvement of his house and grounds,—a man full
of life and originality, gifted with vigorous health,
and joining in his boys’ walks and games.<a id='r951'></a><a href='#f951' class='c016'><sup>[951]</sup></a> In his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>quiet little valley it was easy for Daniel Malthus to
picture to himself a Millennial Hall of the future
in store for every one else, on the type of his own
Rookery, with no worse interruption than the rooks
that cawed there nightly on the hill above him.
From his son’s description<a id='r952'></a><a href='#f952' class='c016'><sup>[952]</sup></a> and his own letters, we
gather that he was one of the best sort of the
Enlightened followers of Nature. He knew Rousseau
personally, and became his executor;<a id='r953'></a><a href='#f953' class='c016'><sup>[953]</sup></a> but they were
liker in views than in character; Daniel Malthus had
a deeper vein of reverence and a stronger inclination
to put theory into practice.<a id='r954'></a><a href='#f954' class='c016'><sup>[954]</sup></a> The neighbours thought
him an amiable and clever man who was an ornament
to his parish, but decidedly eccentric, for he made few
friends and was fondest of his own and his children’s
company.<a id='r955'></a><a href='#f955' class='c016'><sup>[955]</sup></a> He was versed beyond his compeers in
French and German literature, or he would hardly have
been credited with having translated <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paul et Virginie</span></cite>,
D’Ermenonville’s <cite>Essay on Landscape</cite>, and the <cite>Sorrows
of Werther</cite>. We have Robert’s authority for saying
that, although he wrote no translations, he wrote
many pieces that were very successful, but always
anonymous.<a id='r956'></a><a href='#f956' class='c016'><sup>[956]</sup></a> With much of his son’s talent, he had
no power, like his son’s, of sustained intellectual effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>He saw the boy’s promise early, and gave him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>an education which is condemned by Robert’s chief
biographer as irregular and desultory, but had a
method in it. He believed that sons are always
what their fathers were at their age, with the same
kind of faults and virtues; and the men whose
influence would have been best for himself would,
he thought, be the best teachers for Robert. At
the same time he believed with the “Émile” that
a sort of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez faire</span></i> was the best policy in the
education of children; they should be left to grow,
and use their own eyes and hands and heads for
themselves. At the age of nine or ten, say in the
year 1776, Robert was accordingly delivered over to
Mr. Richard Graves, Rector of Claverton, near Bath,
to be taught little but Latin and good behaviour,
along with a few other boys, most of them older
than himself. Graves, who was Daniel’s senior by
some years, had been intimate with the poet
Shenstone at Pembroke College, Oxford, “a society
which for half a century” (on Johnson’s partial
testimony) “was eminent for English poetry and
elegant literature.” From his novel, <cite>The Spiritual
Quixote, or the Summer’s Ramble of Mr. Geoffry
Wildgoose</cite>,<a id='r957'></a><a href='#f957' class='c016'><sup>[957]</sup></a> we should not fancy him the best guide
for ingenuous youth. The book is a coarse and
offensive satire on Whitfield and Wesley;<a id='r958'></a><a href='#f958' class='c016'><sup>[958]</sup></a> and shows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>Graves as a clergyman to be liker Laurence Sterne
than Dr. Primrose. “Don Roberto,” however, as the
tutor nicknamed his pupil, was fonder of fun and
fighting than of his books, and at the ripe age of
ten is not likely to have been troubled about the
universe or about clerical consistency. From Graves
he passed<a id='r959'></a><a href='#f959' class='c016'><sup>[959]</sup></a> into the hands of a much better man,
Gilbert Wakefield, a clergyman who had rebelled
against the Articles, turned dissenter, and become
classical master of an academy at Warrington,
founded in 1779 “to provide a course of liberal
education for the sons of dissenters, and particularly
for dissenting ministers.”<a id='r960'></a><a href='#f960' class='c016'><sup>[960]</sup></a> About one-third of the
boys at the Warrington Academy were sons of
members of the Church of England, who were, like
Daniel Malthus, liberal in their opinions, and wished
their sons to be likewise. Wakefield held decided
views on education; and they were in close accordance
with Daniel and the Émile. “The greatest
service of tuition,” he said, “to any youth, is to
teach him the exercise of his own powers, to conduct
him to the hill of knowledge by that gradual process
in which he sees and secures his own way, and rejoices
in a consciousness of his own faculties and his own
proficiency. Puppies and sciolists alone can be
expected to be formed by any other process.”<a id='r961'></a><a href='#f961' class='c016'><sup>[961]</sup></a> The
tutor’s best service is to point the pupil to the best
authors and give him advice (not lectures) when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>wants it. There was self-denial as well as wisdom
in Wakefield’s view, for in one case at least the
pupil showed his proficiency by departing from the
opinions of his tutor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wakefield, himself a Fellow of Jesus,<a id='r962'></a><a href='#f962' class='c016'><sup>[962]</sup></a> procured
Malthus an entrance to that college, and directed
his studies till he matriculated there as a pensioner
(or ordinary commoner) on 17th December, 1784,
beginning residence in 1785.<a id='r963'></a><a href='#f963' class='c016'><sup>[963]</sup></a> Robert esteemed him
highly. He described him twenty years afterwards<a id='r964'></a><a href='#f964' class='c016'><sup>[964]</sup></a>
as a man “of the strictest and most inflexible integrity,”
who gave up not only prospects of preferment,
but even opportunities of usefulness, rather than deny
the truth and offend his conscience,—a man hot and
intemperate in public controversy,<a id='r965'></a><a href='#f965' class='c016'><sup>[965]</sup></a> but modest and
genial in society, never advancing his opinions till
challenged, nor trying to make converts to them,
but urging others to an independent study of the
facts,—finally, a genius cramped by its own learning
and good memory, never taking time and pains to
do itself justice in its writings. Though a foe to the
thirty-nine Articles, Wakefield was a stout believer in
Christianity, and attacked Paine’s <cite>Age of Reason</cite> in
a rough style that contrasts strongly with the sober
remarks of Malthus on Paine’s <cite>Rights of Man</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>Up to 1785, therefore, his father and Wakefield
had the largest share in the education of Malthus;
and their influence was shown in the very fact that
the opinions of Malthus were not fixed by them.
His opinions were to be of his own forming; and,
having never learned the schoolboy’s ambition of
prize-taking,<a id='r966'></a><a href='#f966' class='c016'><sup>[966]</sup></a> he found time at college not only for
what would give him the best degree, but for every
study that interested him, especially history and
poetry and modern languages, as in his later years
for Italian literature. Frend, author of a political
tract, <cite>Peace and Union</cite>, which brought him the
honour of prosecution,<a id='r967'></a><a href='#f967' class='c016'><sup>[967]</sup></a> was his college tutor, and
spoke highly of him.<a id='r968'></a><a href='#f968' class='c016'><sup>[968]</sup></a> It says much for his mathematical
powers that in spite of his wide general reading
he took the ninth place among the wranglers of
his year, 1788. If he had been confining himself,
as his father supposed, to the beaten track, he might,
like Paley, have reached the senior wranglership.<a id='r969'></a><a href='#f969' class='c016'><sup>[969]</sup></a>
After the Tripos he proposed to study at Cambridge
and at home on a plan of his own. His father, on
the false analogy of his own experience, had warned
him against the abstract studying of scientific and
mathematical principles apart from their applications;
he must not “work curious stitches on a piece of rag”;
he must become a practical surveyor, mechanic, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>navigator. The son had answered that there would
be ample time after the Tripos to make the applications,
and there was little enough time in three
years to study the principles. But thereafter, “if
you will give me leave to proceed in my own plans
of reading for the next two years (I speak with submission
to your judgment), I promise you at the
expiration of that time to be a decent natural philosopher,
and not only to know a few principles, but
to be able to apply these principles in a variety of
useful problems.”<a id='r970'></a><a href='#f970' class='c016'><sup>[970]</sup></a> In reality, so far from having his
father’s tendency to abstract speculation, he was (as
he says himself) rather “remarked in college for
talking of what actually exists in nature or may be
put to real practical use.”<a id='r971'></a><a href='#f971' class='c016'><sup>[971]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Though the son had the best of this personal controversy,
he would have done well to have responded
to his father’s letters in the spirit in which they were
written; in one instance at least, his father complains
that Robert “drove him back into himself.” But
this was rare. His father describes him as an admirable
companion, sympathetic and generous, and
making everybody easy and amused about him.<a id='r972'></a><a href='#f972' class='c016'><sup>[972]</sup></a>
He was a favourite at home. When the family was
removing from the Rookery at Dorking to the
Cottage<a id='r973'></a><a href='#f973' class='c016'><sup>[973]</sup></a> at Albury in 1787, he was told: “You must
find your way to us over bricks and tiles and meet
with five in a bed and some of us under hedges, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>everybody says they will make room for Robert.” It
was Robert’s own warm heart that led him to give
those years of leisure after the Tripos to studies very
different from those of his first plan. Social problems
were competing for his attention with scientific.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1797 he took his Master’s degree. In the
same year he got a fellowship at his college; wrote
but, on his father’s advice, did not print the <cite>Crisis</cite>;<a id='r974'></a><a href='#f974' class='c016'><sup>[974]</sup></a>
and took a curacy near Albury. If the <cite>Crisis</cite> did
nothing more, it showed how the attention of the
man was fixing itself on the subjects that engrossed
him during life, and how his character was changing
from gay to grave. It is difficult for a reader of
the later <cite>Essay</cite> or the <cite>Political Economy</cite> to conceive
that the writer could ever have been very merry in
heart or light in touch; and there is a still wider
distance between the pugnacious Don Roberto, never
long without a black eye, and the grave gentle host
of Miss Martineau at the East India College. The
change in style between his early writings and his
later was due to a real change in character, produced
by the concentration of his thoughts on the problem
of poverty. The success of the first <cite>Essay on Population</cite><a id='r975'></a><a href='#f975' class='c016'><sup>[975]</sup></a>
fixed for him the work of his life. He was to
set one neglected truth clearly before the world; and
he devoted himself wholly to it, pushing his inquiries
not only by study of authorities and facts at home,<a id='r976'></a><a href='#f976' class='c016'><sup>[976]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>but by his own<a id='r977'></a><a href='#f977' class='c016'><sup>[977]</sup></a> and his friends’<a id='r978'></a><a href='#f978' class='c016'><sup>[978]</sup></a> travels, and by
conversation and correspondence with all that were
likely to give him anything in conference.<a id='r979'></a><a href='#f979' class='c016'><sup>[979]</sup></a> He sacrificed
to it, fortunately or unfortunately, his youthful
buoyancy and freshness of style, though in speculation
his opinions passed from pessimism to a moderate
optimism, and he was never too old in spirit to unlearn
a fault.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his mature writings the composition is less faulty
than the diction, which is certainly too Johnsonian.
The composition is a little bald and often diffuse;
but the meaning of each sentence is always clear, and
in economical writing that is the first of virtues. In
a work of imagination we may desire to have the
greatest number of the greatest ideas put into each
sentence; but a scientific treatise is more often concerned
with a single truth in its full development;
and the perpetual recurrence of the same phrases in
different connections is unavoidable, in proportion to
the thoroughness of the discussion. Great variety of
language would either imply in the writer or cause in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>the reader some confusion of thought. It is not surprising,
then, to find Malthus saying substantially the
same thing in nearly the same words, whether he is
presenting his views on Population directly in a book
on the subject, or placing them in their economical
context in a book on Political Economy, or touching
them incidentally in a Corn Law pamphlet or <cite>Quarterly</cite>
article, or answering questions about them before a
Commons Committee. His abundant metaphors in
the first essay<a id='r980'></a><a href='#f980' class='c016'><sup>[980]</sup></a> had simply led to misunderstanding;
and he deliberately renounced fine writing for high
thinking, present popularity for permanent usefulness.<a id='r981'></a><a href='#f981' class='c016'><sup>[981]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The first essay was the turning-point in his literary
life. Except the pamphlets on Haileybury College,
all his later writings are economical. His personal
history, being uneventful, was, like a time of dull
annals, presumably happy. The fine portrait of him
by Linnell,<a id='r982'></a><a href='#f982' class='c016'><sup>[982]</sup></a> taken in his old age, gives a pleasing
impression, not only of mildness and firmness, but
of serene contentment, without any trace of physical
suffering or physical defect, though it is certain he
had the latter.<a id='r983'></a><a href='#f983' class='c016'><sup>[983]</sup></a> In person he was tall and “elegantly
formed.”<a id='r984'></a><a href='#f984' class='c016'><sup>[984]</sup></a> 1799 is the year of his first Continental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>journey.<a id='r985'></a><a href='#f985' class='c016'><sup>[985]</sup></a> In January 1800 his father died, at the age
of seventy. In the same year appeared the tract on
<cite>The High Price of Provisions</cite>. In 1802 Malthus was
again on the Continent.<a id='r986'></a><a href='#f986' class='c016'><sup>[986]</sup></a> In June 1803 he published
the second (or quarto) essay, which seems, from a
passage in Edward Clarke’s <cite>Travels</cite>, to have been
long expected by his friends. “I am sorry,” writes
Clarke to him from Constantinople on 16th March,
1802, “to find you confess your breach of duty in
not having written a book. But you have been
engaged in the press, because I heard at the Palace
that you had published a new edition of your <cite>Population</cite>,
and, moreover, I was there assured so long
ago as last year that you had written a work on the
Scarcity of Corn. How does this accord with your
declaration? Perhaps it is a pamphlet, and therefore
strictly not ‘a book.’”<a id='r987'></a><a href='#f987' class='c016'><sup>[987]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is not impossible that Clarke had heard this
rumour from Lord Elgin, and Lord Elgin from Pitt
himself, for Pitt had visited Cambridge on the eve
of the dissolution following the Peace of Amiens. On
the 16th (December 1801) he was present at the Commemoration
dinner in Trinity College Hall.<a id='r988'></a><a href='#f988' class='c016'><sup>[988]</sup></a> The visit
is described by Otter:<a id='r989'></a><a href='#f989' class='c016'><sup>[989]</sup></a> “It happened that Mr. Pitt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>was at this time upon a sort of canvassing visit at
the university.... At a supper at Jesus Lodge in
the company of some young travellers, particularly
Mr. Malthus, &amp;c., he was induced to unbend in a very
easy conversation respecting Sir Sidney Smith, the
massacre at Jaffa, the Pacha of Acre, Clarke, Carlisle,<a id='r990'></a><a href='#f990' class='c016'><sup>[990]</sup></a>
&amp;c.” Though the talk was largely on poetry and
foreign politics, it may easily have embraced economics;
and the personal meeting may have helped to
gain Malthus his appointment as Professor of History
and Political Economy at Haileybury College. With
or without Pitt, the appointment was made in 1805;
and in view of it Malthus was able to carry out,
on 13th March 1804, his marriage with Harriet
Eckersall (daughter of John Eckersall of Claverton
House, St. Catherine’s, near Bath), to whom he had
probably been for some years engaged.<a id='r991'></a><a href='#f991' class='c016'><sup>[991]</sup></a> In 1806 he
published the third edition of the essay (in two
volumes), in 1807 the fourth edition, and also the
letter to Samuel Whitbread on his Bill for amending
the Poor Laws. If it is true that he visited Owen
at New Lanark, it must have been in the course of
the next seven years.<a id='r992'></a><a href='#f992' class='c016'><sup>[992]</sup></a> There is nothing signed from
his pen in that time but a letter to Lord Grenville in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>defence of the East India College;<a id='r993'></a><a href='#f993' class='c016'><sup>[993]</sup></a> but in 1814 and
1815 he wrote the <cite>Observations on the Corn Laws</cite>, the
<cite>Grounds of an Opinion on the Policy of restricting Importation</cite>,
and <cite>The Nature and Progress of Rent</cite>. In
1807 he had been with Horner in Wales, impressing
Horner, as they went together from Raglan to Abergavenny,
with his idea that the people should “live
dear”;<a id='r994'></a><a href='#f994' class='c016'><sup>[994]</sup></a> and in 1817 he visited Kerry and Westmeath.
In the same year, 1817, he published the fifth edition
of his essay. 1818 would be memorable to him as
the year when Mackintosh joined him at Haileybury
as Professor of General Polity and Law in
succession to Mr. Christian. In 1819 Malthus appears
as Fellow of the Royal Society, though the honour
did not tempt him back into physical science.<a id='r995'></a><a href='#f995' class='c016'><sup>[995]</sup></a> In
1820 appeared the first edition of the <cite>Political
Economy</cite>. In 1821, Thomas Tooke, the author of
<cite>High and Low Prices</cite>, founded the Political Economy
Club, James Mill drafting the rules. Malthus, Grote,
and Ricardo were among its members; and the
survivors are said to remember well the “crushing
criticisms” by James Mill of Malthus’ speeches.<a id='r996'></a><a href='#f996' class='c016'><sup>[996]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>1823 is the year of the tract on the <cite>Measure
of Value</cite> and the <cite>Quarterly</cite> article on Tooke; 1824
of the paper on Population in the <cite>Supplement to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>the Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, and the article on the
New Political Economy in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>.<a id='r997'></a><a href='#f997' class='c016'><sup>[997]</sup></a>
In 1825 he lost a daughter, and went for his own
and his wife’s health to the Continent. In that
year he contributed his first paper to the Royal
Society of Literature, of which he had been made an
Associate two years before; and that year saw Empson
take the place of Mackintosh at Haileybury. In 1826
was published the sixth edition of the essay, the
last published in his lifetime. In 1827 we find him
before the Emigration Committee, and we have from
his pen the <cite>Definitions in Political Economy</cite>, and the
second paper contributed to the Royal Society of
Literature. In 1829 letters passed between him and
W. Nassau Senior, which were appended by the latter
to his <cite>Lectures on Population</cite>. In 1830 he wrote
the <cite>Summary View</cite>, which involved no new effort.
Indeed his whole time seems to have been spent in
revising his <cite>Political Economy</cite> in the light of his
public and private discussions with Ricardo, though
he did not live to print the new edition himself.
Shortly before his death he said to some one who
rebuked him for his delay: “My views are before
the public. If I am to alter anything, I can do little
more than alter the language, and I don’t know if I
should alter it for the better” (Empson, <em>l. c.</em> p. 472).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>He was one of the first Fellows of the Statistical
Society, founded in March 1834, and its first Annual
Report contains a high eulogy on him and his work;
but he did not live to take much share in its proceedings.
He died suddenly of heart disease on Monday,
29th December, 1834, on a visit to Mr. Eckersall at
St. Catherine’s, where he was spending Christmas
with his wife and family. He is buried in the Abbey
Church at Bath, in the north aisle of the nave. Of
his three children, two survived him, of whom one,
a daughter, is still living.<a id='r998'></a><a href='#f998' class='c016'><sup>[998]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Brougham, in a letter to Macvey Napier (31st
Jan., 1837), denies the truth of an assertion of
Empson’s, that Lords Lansdowne and Holland tried
to get preferment for Malthus, but failed; on the
contrary, he had himself, he says, offered Malthus a
living, but Malthus had declined it in favour of his
son, Henry,<a id='r999'></a><a href='#f999' class='c016'><sup>[999]</sup></a> “who got it, and I believe now has it.”
Henry, however, did not become vicar of Effingham
(near Leatherhead in Surrey) till 1835, the year
after his father’s death,—or of Donnington (near
Chichester in Sussex) till 1837, the year when
Brougham was writing. The second appointment
may have been due to Empson’s reproach or Otter’s
influence. Henry died in August 1882 at the age
of seventy-six. Since, between the two parishes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>he kept as many as four curates at a time, the
combined salaries of the two, amounting to £672,
seem a small income.<a id='r1000'></a><a href='#f1000' class='c016'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> His father himself told Gallois,
the French publicist, in 1820, that all his works till
then had not brought him above £1000. Gallois,
repeating this to the poet Moore, slily remarked that
in England poetry seemed to be better paid than
useful learning.<a id='r1001'></a><a href='#f1001' class='c016'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> There is no reason for the belief
that Malthus was made rich by the second essay,<a id='r1002'></a><a href='#f1002' class='c016'><sup>[1002]</sup></a>
or indeed by anything else. He did not go the
right way to be rich. He could no doubt have got
Church preferment if he had pursued it like Paley.
At the end of his days, even if he had desired it,
he was too mild a partisan to be a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">grata persona</span></i>
to the Whigs in office; he had acquiesced in the
Reform of 1832, but without enthusiasm,<a id='r1003'></a><a href='#f1003' class='c016'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> having a
livelier interest in social than in political changes.
But the world after all used him kindly. Of worldly
comfort, after 1805, he had enough; and he was
fully satisfied, as he had reason to be, with his lot in
the East India College. It gave him nearly thirty
years of the leisure which Godwin had justly counted
the true riches of life.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>The position had its cares, for the college was an
educational experiment. Governor-General Wellesley<a id='r1004'></a><a href='#f1004' class='c016'><sup>[1004]</sup></a>
had proposed to found a college at Fort William,
Calcutta, for the general education of the civil servants
of the Company as well as their special instruction in
Oriental languages. He pointed out that their functions,
judicial, administrative, diplomatic, were now
totally unlike their names of writer, factor, and
merchant, and they needed something higher than
the commercial training which was all that was then
required of them. The Directors of the East India
Company carried out his wishes so far as to allow
Fort William College to do the advanced training in
languages; but they thought that the general education
should be given before the cadets left England,
and at the end of 1805 they passed a scheme for
establishing for that purpose a college at Haileybury,
near Hertford. On their nomination, instead of
going out at once to India, the future civil servants
of India were to spend two or three years at Haileybury,
and to receive <em>first</em> a General education on the
lines of Oxford and Cambridge, and <em>second</em> a Special
education to prepare them for their duties in their
province.<a id='r1005'></a><a href='#f1005' class='c016'><sup>[1005]</sup></a> The Professor of “History and Political
Economy” and the Professor of “General Polity and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>the Laws of England” were regarded as giving both
the general and the special kinds of training. “As
the study of law and political economy” (so runs the
scheme) “is to form an essential part in the general
system of education, it will be required that, in the
lectures upon these subjects, particular attention be
given to the explanation of the political and commercial
relations subsisting between India and Great
Britain.”<a id='r1006'></a><a href='#f1006' class='c016'><sup>[1006]</sup></a> The two professors were required to
give “(1) a course of lectures on general history and
on the history and statistics of the modern nations
of Europe, (2) a course of lectures on political
economy, (3) a course of lectures on general polity,
on the laws of England and principles of the British
Constitution.”<a id='r1007'></a><a href='#f1007' class='c016'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> The other subjects were Classics,
Oriental Languages, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy.
The college course lasted, as a rule, two
years, each year consisting of two terms of about five
months each (Feb. to June, Aug. to Dec.); and there
were periodical examinations, honour lists, and prizes.
The ages of the pupils ranged from as low as fifteen
to as high as twenty-two, and about forty joined
every year. Malthus would seldom have a class
beyond twelve or fourteen, all in the later year of
their course.<a id='r1008'></a><a href='#f1008' class='c016'><sup>[1008]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The general discipline of the classes and the surveillance
or want of surveillance of the pupils in their
private rooms were rather on the model of an unreformed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>Oxford college than of a public school.<a id='r1009'></a><a href='#f1009' class='c016'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> Sense
of personal responsibility and habits of self-government
were to take the place of the schoolboy’s fear
of punishment. Unhappily, before learning the new
motives, the boys too often abused the absence of
the old.<a id='r1010'></a><a href='#f1010' class='c016'><sup>[1010]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>About half of the professors were in holy orders
and did duty in the college chapel. If Malthus took
his turn with the rest, we need not suppose with his
clerical biographer that he magnified the office. His
sermons would always be earnest; they might often
perhaps be too long. His week-day lectures, unless
he made them liker the first essay with its fine writing
than the later books with their plain unvarnished
arguments, could not have been very fascinating to
immature youths, especially as the lecturer had a
slight defect in utterance.<a id='r1011'></a><a href='#f1011' class='c016'><sup>[1011]</sup></a> Eight years of teaching
convinced him that Political Economy was not, as
he once thought, too hard for boys of sixteen or
seventeen;—“they could not only understand it,” he
said, “but they did not even think it dull.”<a id='r1012'></a><a href='#f1012' class='c016'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>may hope it was so; but in view of the whole case,
it is probable that our author’s labours, in the classroom
and out of it, were far from light, and that the
pleasantness of the life was purchased with a large
share of discomfort.</p>

<p class='c007'>The physical surroundings were all that could be
desired. “We are so rural and quiet here, that there
can be no greater contrast [to London]. This house
is in a cluster of tall shrubs and young trees, with a
little bit of smooth lawn sloping to a bright pond, in
which old weeping willows are dipping their hair, and
rows of young pear trees admiring their blooming faces.
Indeed, there never was such a flash of shadowing
high-hanging flowers as we have around us; and
almost all, as it happens, of that pure, silvery,
snowy, bridal tint; and we live, like Campbell’s sweet
Gertrude, ‘as if beneath a galaxy of overhanging
sweets, with blossoms white.’ There are young
horse-chestnuts with flowers half a yard long, fresh,
full-clustered white lilacs, tall Guelder roses, broadspreading
pear and cherry trees, low thickets of
blooming sloe, and crowds of juicy-looking detached
thorns, quite covered with their fragrant May-flowers,
half open, like ivory filigree, and half shut like
Indian pearls, and all so fresh and dewy since the
milky showers of yesterday; and resounding with
nightingales, and thrushes, and skylarks, shrilling
high up, overhead, among the dazzling slow-sailing
clouds. Not to be named, I know and feel as much
as you can do, with your Trossachs, and Loch
Lomonds, and Inverarys; but very sweet, and vernal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>and soothing, and fit enough to efface all recollections
of hot, swarming, whirling, and bustling London
from all good minds.”<a id='r1013'></a><a href='#f1013' class='c016'><sup>[1013]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Equally pleasant is a glimpse of the daily life at
Haileybury, given by Miss Martineau, who saw it in
1833. Malthus considered her one of his best
expositors;—“whereas his friends had done him all
manner of mischief by defending him injudiciously, my
tales had represented his views precisely as he could
have wished;”—and he was at the pains to seek her
out in London and bring her down to the college.<a id='r1014'></a><a href='#f1014' class='c016'><sup>[1014]</sup></a>
“It was a delightful visit, and the well-planted county
of Herts was a welcome change from the pavement
of London in August.... My room was a large and
airy one, with a bay window and a charming view.”<a id='r1015'></a><a href='#f1015' class='c016'><sup>[1015]</sup></a>
She found desk, books, and everything needed for
her work. Her entertainers had guessed from her
books that she must be, like Malthus himself,<a id='r1016'></a><a href='#f1016' class='c016'><sup>[1016]</sup></a> fond
of riding; and she found her riding-habit and whip
ready. Exploring the green lanes round Amwell,
Ware, and Hertford, on horseback, in parties of five
or six, seems to have been the chief amusement.
“The subdued jests and external homage and occasional
insurrections of the young men, the archery
of the young ladies, the curious politeness of the
Persian professor [Ibrahim], the fine learning and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>eager scholarship of Principal<a id='r1017'></a><a href='#f1017' class='c016'><sup>[1017]</sup></a> Le Bas, and the somewhat
old-fashioned courtesies of the summer evening
parties are all over now, except as pleasant pictures
in the interior gallery of those who knew the place,
of whom I am thankful to have been one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When she again visited Haileybury, Malthus was
gone; Professor Jones was in his chair, and Empson
in his house, probably one of the most comfortable
in a building which, if smaller, was much more
picturesque than the present school.<a id='r1018'></a><a href='#f1018' class='c016'><sup>[1018]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The “occasional insurrections of the young men”
were a feature of the college from the beginning.
Sydney Smith writes to Lord Holland in June 1810,
when there was talk of making Mackintosh professor
at Haileybury: “The season for lapidating the professors
is now at hand; keep Mackintosh quiet at
Holland House till all is over;”<a id='r1019'></a><a href='#f1019' class='c016'><sup>[1019]</sup></a> and to Whishaw
in January 1818, when the appointment had been
made: “His situation at Hertford will suit him very
well, peltings and contusions always excepted. He
should stipulate for ‘pebble money,’ as it is technically
termed, or an annual pension in case he is disabled
by the pelting of the students. By the bye, might
it not be advisable for the professors to learn the
use of the sling (<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">balearia habena</span></i>)? It would give
them a great advantage over the students.”<a id='r1020'></a><a href='#f1020' class='c016'><sup>[1020]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>lapidations were probably no worse than similar
scenes at our English and Scotch Universities that
have not yet destroyed the credit of these institutions.
But the opponents of the college complained of
much more than the insubordination of the students.
Lord Grenville had made an attack on it (in April
1813), on the ground that it separated the future
Civil servants from the ordinary life of Englishmen,
and prevented them from becoming imbued with
“English manners, English attachments, English
principles, and I am not ashamed to say English
prejudices.”<a id='r1021'></a><a href='#f1021' class='c016'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> Malthus, who had gone up to London
to hear Grenville’s speech in the House of Lords,
became champion of the college, and had no
difficulty in meeting this assault. The defence of
the professors, as set forth by him in 1817,<a id='r1022'></a><a href='#f1022' class='c016'><sup>[1022]</sup></a> was that
the plan of the college was good in theory and had
proved good in practice. The insubordination was
due to the dependence of the professorial staff upon
the Company’s Directors, who had (till then) withheld
from the teachers their best means of discipline, the
power of expulsion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The students were as little likely as army or navy
cadets to become un-English; and they were much
less likely to form a caste at Haileybury than if they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>had been sent to an Indian college. The details of
this extinct controversy need not detain us. It is
enough to say that Malthus discharged his part with
great vigour and something of his early vivacity. At
the best, it must be confessed, the college was a
compromise; and the unavoidable difficulties of the
situation were quite enough to try the mettle of the
teachers. The cadets of the first year might be fifteen
or they might be eighteen, and there was no natural
aristocracy of senior boys to check the juniors. Those
of the younger age were physically and mentally
more like schoolboys than undergraduates, and unfit,
as yet, for the quasi-independent life of the latter.
Many were unwilling to go to India at all, and it
was their parents or guardians who really feared the
expulsion of incorrigibles. But it was better that
the unfit should be rejected in England, where they
could find other openings, than in India, where they
could find none; and it was better their training
should be carried on where the climate, the expense,
and the moral, social, and intellectual advantages were
in keeping with their age and their state of pupilage.
“Little other change is wanting,” in the system as
it then was, “than that an appointment should be
considered in spirit and in truth, not in mere words,
as a prize to be contended for, not a property already
possessed,<a id='r1023'></a><a href='#f1023' class='c016'><sup>[1023]</sup></a> which may be lost. If the Directors were
to appoint one-fifth every year beyond the number
finally to go out, and the four-fifths were to be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>beat of the whole body, the appointments would then
really be prizes to be contended for, and the effects
would be admirable. Each appointment to the college
would then be of less value; but they would be more
in number, and the patronage would hardly suffer.
A Director could not then, indeed, be able to send
out an unqualified son. But is it fitting that he
should? This is a fair question for the consideration
of the Legislature and the British public.”<a id='r1024'></a><a href='#f1024' class='c016'><sup>[1024]</sup></a> In these
matters, at least, Malthus was no reactionary.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of Joseph Hume and its other enemies, the
college lived out its half-century, and does not die
out, on the pages of the <cite>India Register</cite>, till the death
of the Company in 1858. Its monopoly was gone
some time before then. An Act of 1827 provided,
theoretically, for the examination and appointment
of India Civil servants who had not studied at
Hertford College. In 1833 provision was made for
the limited competition which Malthus had recommended.<a id='r1025'></a><a href='#f1025' class='c016'><sup>[1025]</sup></a>
In 1855 came the end. The Company was
“relieved of the obligation to keep up the college;”
the reign of open competition, ushered in by Macaulay’s
Report (Nov. 1854), brought a new order of
things; and the college was only continued till those
who had joined it at the time of the change had been
able to finish their course.<a id='r1026'></a><a href='#f1026' class='c016'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> There are numbers of old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>officials, like Sir William Muir, who still hold it
in affectionate remembrance;<a id='r1027'></a><a href='#f1027' class='c016'><sup>[1027]</sup></a> but except in their
memory it exists no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of Malthus was less in the East India
College than in his writings. But his connection
with the college was perhaps the most important of
the external facts of his life; and it has helped to
preserve a record of scenes and incidents which reveal
the character more clearly than all the adjectives of
panegyrists. Otter, Empson, Miss Martineau, Sydney
Smith,<a id='r1028'></a><a href='#f1028' class='c016'><sup>[1028]</sup></a> and Horner,<a id='r1029'></a><a href='#f1029' class='c016'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> may supply the panegyrics; and
the eulogy of Mackintosh is remarkable: “I have
known Adam Smith slightly, Ricardo well, Malthus
intimately. Is it not something to say for a science
that its three great masters were about the three best
men I ever knew?”<a id='r1030'></a><a href='#f1030' class='c016'><sup>[1030]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>His epitaph in Bath Abbey, probably from the pen
of Otter, is given on the following page.</p>

Malthus, asking about the Foundling Hospital at St. Petersburg (date
March 1800). Cf. <em>ibid.</em>, p. 39: “As for Malthus, tell him he is not

his mere love of truth above the eloquence and versatility of others,

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
